Product Designer,Culture Amp,Melbourne VIC,https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=4edf56fc496f1971&fccid=f29bfe17a11869dd&vjs=3,None,None,"Who We Are
What do Airbnb, Slack and Salesforce have in common? They use Culture Amp every day to make their workplaces better, along with over 3,000 other companies from around the globe, making up a community who stand together to improve the world of work.
With offices in Melbourne, San Francisco, New York, and London, Culture Amp isn’t just for fast-growing startups - we’re for every organization that wants to put culture first. By making it easy to collect, understand, and act on employee feedback, we enable teams to make better decisions, demonstrate impact, and turn company culture into a competitive edge.
It’s what makes us the world’s leading people & culture platform.
The Opportunity at Culture Amp
Culture Amp is looking for a Product Designer to join us on our mission to positively impact the world of work by creating as many culture-first companies possible through accessible people analytics. Not only is design seen as a critical part of Culture Amp’s success this is a unique opportunity where the things you create will have a genuine, positive impact on workers globally.
This role will be part of our Platform Camp which is our largest camp and is made up of several different, highly skilled teams working across our entire stack – from cross-cutting user interface and back end code to infrastructure, data science and machine learning.
As one of the members of our highly talented design practice, you will:
Solve deep and complex problems that impact a large audience
Talk to customers regularly to understand their pain points
Conceive, design and prototype useful, usable, and compelling user experiences that help solve those problems
Create user-flows, prototypes and UI designs that help solve those problems (visual design skills not essential)
Conduct usability testing and iterate quickly towards designs that meet our users’ needs

What You Bring to Our Camp
4+ years working as a full-time product, UX or interaction designer (or similar role)
Experience working collaboratively with PMs and engineers to deliver end-to-end product design, from ideation to production.
Comfortable articulating the ‘why’, and leading discussions around your process, explorations, and conclusions.
You are deeply curious and passionate about people and culture. At heart, you're what we call a people geek.
Day in the Life (Realistic Job Preview)
Here at Culture Amp, we all pitch in to make things work even when some tasks don’t fall squarely within the “job description”. Don’t be surprised if you see our CEO unloading the dishwasher or our People Scientists moving furniture around to help set up a Geekup event (when we are back in the office of course!). We’re all about doing whatever it takes to amplify others and help us all be more successful. Though every role has its rewards and compelling aspects, we all have to commit to following through on some of the more challenging parts of the job. In this role, a few examples of some of the less exciting activities include:
You will be working in a market that is constantly changing and pivoting
Distributed office locations and customer bases, sometimes require you to be available outside of hours to talk to customers
Distributed design practice can mean you may need to put more effort into connecting with your wider team.
What we offer
Culture Amp really practices what we preach. We are extremely proud of the Culture we have built, but don't just take our word for it, our Glassdoor reviews speak for themselves!
We want every Camper to feel at home and do their best work at Culture Amp, so we have 4 values that we live by, take a read, and if this sounds like the environment for you, please apply!
We have a strong commitment to Anti-Racism, and we believe in leading through example. Every step we make as a business towards anti-racism is another step we can support our customers in making a better world of work. You can see our current commitments to Anti-Racism here.
But that’s not all!
Flexible working hours - in this (please don't say unprecedented again!) time, make your work schedule work for you
14 weeks parental leave at full pay for primary carers and 4 weeks for secondary carers
MacBooks for all!
Shares - it’s important to us that everyone is an owner and can share in our success.
Fun and inclusive digital, and (in the future) in-person events
Most importantly. An opportunity to really make a difference in people’s lives.
Please keep reading...
Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We'd love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.

Work type: Casual
Location: Parkville
Division/Faculty: Melbourne Law School
Salary: $67,262 - $73,669 (RA Grade 1)
Role & Superannuation rate: Academic - Part time - 9.5% super
About Melbourne Law School:

Melbourne Law School (MLS) is Australia's first all-graduate law faculty. Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.
Dr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.

About the project:

Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.

About the role:

The successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.

About you:

Applications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview.

PhD Scholarship in BAE IMCRC Data Linking Analytics,University of South Australia,South Australia,https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2af479fcae1586a7&fccid=e20fe9808db75620&vjs=3,4.3,"$37,285 a year","PhD scholarship position in Artificial Intelligence/Computer Science
The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants
$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension


About the scholarship

The University of South Australia is welcoming applications for a PhD position in Artificial Intelligence/Computer Science to work on the project ""Application of Narrative Visualisation and Big Data to Improve High Value Manufacturing"" funded by BAE Systems and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.

Discrete manufacturing in Defence inherently relies on participants in the supply chain performing at a very high-quality level without full visibility of what is happening elsewhere in the chain. Human-in-the-loop decision making is fundamental in high value complex manufacture, both to correct defects and increase operational efficiency. The problem is a latency of presenting appropriate data to the critical decision makers. Data captured from disparate Industry 4.0 technologies can be transformed into a trusted data driven decision support tool, based on big data and smart visualisation techniques.

The project seeks to develop novel artificial intelligence techniques for analysing and linking data across the supply chain and to create interactive decision support tools for advanced manufacturing in Defence. The successful applicant will develop novel artificial intelligence methods for linking and analysing data across a manufacturing supply chain.

The recipient should have an outstanding academic record and a background in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence.

Eligibility

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements for a research degree program at the University of South Australia.

Candidates born in ITAR-proscribed countries and nationals of IT AR-proscribed countries are ineligible. Please check the list of denial countries in ITAR legislation at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/126.1 prior to applying.

Value

$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension. An additional $2,500 is available for equipment upon commencement.

How to apply and closing date

In the first instance, interested applicants should send their CV and academic transcript to Dr Wolfgang Mayer at Wolfgang.mayer@unisa.edu.au and following the initial endorsement by the supervisor, you will be required to go through the UniSA online application process.

This scholarship will remain open for applications until filled.

Fishermans Bend - VIC
The Role
Rapid advances in small, tactical-UAS and soldier-borne hyperspectral sensors, place dismounted soldiers at significantly increased risk of detection, targeting and ultimately death or disability. Existing camouflage, concealment and deception technologies are over-matched by this emerging tactical threat.

Signature Modelling and Simulation (SMS) science team undertakes the development of signature modelling and simulation capabilities that will allow dynamic, multi-spectrum analysis of signatures and inform counter-measures development such as camouflage solutions for dismounted soldiers and high value land assets.

The successful applicant will be required to undertake computer modelling and simulation under “Lelantos” construct; conduct field and laboratory-based experiments, and to assist DL-SMS to provide supervision to postgraduate, IEP and SVP students; to develop and maintain a hyperspectral spectral library/database for input into soldier signature modelling and simulation capability. The successful applicant will expand their extant knowledge of modelling and virtual simulation to construct 3D high-fidelity soldier signature model including camouflage materials (i.e. cam-net, military fabrics, etc.) and field element models (tree, foliage, grass, etc.). They will use the developed hyperspectral library to spectrally render the land signature model in a virtual environment for use in detectability assessments from ground based or UAV mounted EO/IR sensors, and conduct validation studies using field trials.

The successful applicant will also contribute to the analysis and extraction of distinct spectral features of background elements and materials from the developed spectral “fingerprint” library and will develop and demonstrate hyperspectral signature management solutions using textiles.

About our Team
Land Division leads the impetus for innovation within Australian land force operations by providing science and technology advice about equipment, personnel and processes utilised by the land force. The division helps maintain the capability edge by developing advanced analysis and evaluation techniques, along with computer modelling tools and human factors principles, that enable a rigorous exploration of new system concepts, tactics, doctrines and technologies. The division applies this work in an operational context, at all levels of the Army from brigade/task force down to the individual soldier.

The Integrated Personnel Protection (IPP)Science & Technology Capability (STC) leads the application of evidence-based integrated enabling research and experimentation for the protection of mounted and dismounted personnel.

Science skill sets: ballistic, blast mechanics and development of composites and textile materials and armour systems (including specifications and standards), personnel vulnerability modelling, signature management development and assessment, textile treatments and properties, battle damage assessment of personnel and vehicle systems, energy materials and power sources.

The capability leverages heavily off a broad range of national and international partnerships.

Our Ideal Candidate
Under limited direction and guidance from DL-SMS, you will be responsible for:
1. Ensure a high-level of integration and consistency in support of LPP MSTC’s signature modelling and simulation capability
2. Manage and maintain the currency of Lelantos modelling & simulation hardware and software including MuSES, VBS3, Hyperspectral Database and hyperspectral sensors and instrumentation lab facilities in signature modelling, simulation and measurement disciplines.
3. Implement scientific and engineering methodologies, and generate new knowledge through the development of a high fidelity soldier signature model for emerging threat sensor/platform system assessment and signature countermeasure design and development.
4. Ensure professional scientific and engineering standards are maintained through the established principles.
5. Deliver high quality scientific and engineering reports including briefs and presentations.
6. Work collaboratively, operate as an effective team member and provide constructive feedback.

Key Requirements
1. Specialised in multispectral and hyperspectral signature modelling and simulation.
2. Demonstrated understanding of textile based materials physics and performance.
3. Demonstrated ability to clearly communicate research results, concepts and knowledge.
4. Demonstrated ability to work effectively both as a member of a research team and independently when required, to meet project outcomes and milestones.
5. Demonstrated ability to manage and maintain lab and field instrumentation equipment and conduct hyperspectral data collection field trial.
6. Excellent interpersonal and communications skills appropriate for interacting with key stakeholders - military personnel, international collaborators, university and industry partners, together with a strong commitment to teamwork and multidisciplinary collaboration"

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

We're looking for empathetic, curious and passionate people who are Full Stack Software Engineers to work in a young (as in business) start-up team. We're looking to build a new global technology company based around IoT tracking. We're working on construction right now but our intent is to expand that once we've nailed construction.
Why construction? Easy, construction is a massive global industry that still uses pen and paper in many cases. Right now it is an industry going through a revolution of technology and new ideas. Historically it's been seen as an industry with perennially low productivity and dangerous working conditions.
At Ynomia we are building IoT products that automate the capture of data in difficult construction environments (low power and no mobile reception) to help understand the status of a project. We then make meaning from the data we collect to help teams stay informed and improve the timeliness of decision-making. All so we can help construction teams manage information in real-time through an end-to-end IoT platform solution. They're glad we're here and we're happy to help.
Also, like a lot of good startups, there are so many ways this can go. I talk a lot about technology as a superpower. There's no point in the technology without the people you're trying to help. So here's a couple of super quick examples:
We track bins. Why? Because bins are a proxy for tidy sites (you're getting the good order vibe aren't you?) Tidy sites are safer sites. With 35 construction workers being seriously injured each day (see https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/construction) we clearly have a long way to go. We hypothesise that keeping track of the bins allows them to be emptied more efficiently and should create a virtuous cycle like better sites → less money spent on health and safety (as in payments to injured people) → more profitable sites → more incentive to make better sites.
We provide the real-time status of the critical path, high-value construction materials, like glass facades across the international supply chain. From their creation to their installation. Because you can't get electricians, plasterers doing their jobs until the building is sealed. So if you're a tradie you're very interested in when you need to be on-site and when you can do other things. If you work for a construction company we know that you stress about where those facades and you know that a blockage there can send the entire construction effort into panic mode. So you want to know what's going on with the facades too.
We track plant and equipment on an active job site. In this case, not only do we provide the realtime position of forklifts and scissor-lifts but we also are building safety compliance systems to automatically notify site teams of expiring inspections and unauthorized use.
Hopefully, you get the impression we're trying to create as many winners as possible. So our products have real value to the people who use them and the people who pay for them. And those are just the things we're doing right now. There are so many more stories to tell here.
We are building towards a vision that will create what we call the Connected Jobsite. An integrated platform to support construction teams with the location information of critical resource applications for plant and equipment, asset and machinery, safety and people, progress tracking and more...

Project Description
The practice of podcasting is described by Llinares et al (2018: 5) as ‘a collection of cultural work and practice that spans journalism, performance art, comedy, drama, documentary, criticism and education’, signalling the breadth of the field. Podcasting is described as an immersive medium (cf Dowling and Miller, 2019), relying on the human imagination. Listeners create their own imagery, with their own versions of the characters and the story. It makes for personalised content that is constructed to be immersive and engaging, produced for demanding listeners accustomed to on-demand, in-depth and serialised storytelling on streaming services. As an emerging and interdisciplinary field of study, podcast scholars study podcasting through a range of theoretical and disciplinary lenses

With a broad scope, this scholarship is funded to explore the intersection between podcasting and technology. It can explore the role of technology, innovation and/or networks in production, distribution or consumption of podcasts. The successful candidate will develop a research project that aligns with and expands the aims of the Centre for Transformative Media Technologies, with its key research areas in immersive media such as AR and VR; cyber-physical systems; production innovation in film, television, animation and journalism and visualisation in industry. The PhD project can be done as a traditional thesis or as a practice-based dissertation comprising an exegesis and an artefact.

The PhD project is open to negotiation, with the following some ideas for consideration:
Technological innovations in podcasting (current and new developments) – e.g. mainstreaming, searchable host voices, using AI to curate podcasts, categorisation, innovations in AI, algorithm and data combinations
How other technologies and platforms are adapting to podcasts (e.g. Google, Apple)
How are technological developments driving audio storytelling innovation?

Collaborative environment
The George Institute (‘TGI’) is 700+ people around the world, all focused on improving the health of millions of people worldwide. As a medical research institute affiliated with leading universities and with projects in approximately 50 countries, we are challenging the status quo in healthcare to:
Find better treatments for the world’s biggest health problems
Transform primary health care to support better health for more people
Harness the power of communities, governments and markets to improve health
Our innovative commercial enterprises help maximise our impact.
Over the past few decades, global efforts to improve the health of women and girls have largely focused on reducing unacceptably high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity. These efforts have led to a shift in the global burden of disease for women. In almost every country, non-communicable diseases and injuries (NCDIs) are now the leading causes of mortality and morbidity for women.
The overarching principle of our Global Women’s Health Program is to promote a life-course approach to addressing women’s health issues. This approach encourages researchers to look at women’s and girls’ health and well-being from birth to death as interconnected periods, in which early health-related measures can be indicators for health outcomes later in life.
Our goal is to support the lifelong health, well-being, safety and productivity of women by:
addressing the leading causes of death and disability for women, specifically non-communicable disease and injury
improving our understanding of the biological and social differences between women and men and how those differences affect health
addressing other important women-specific health issues
In line with the Institute’s research priorities of better treatments, better care and healthier societies, the Global Women’s Health Program takes a multi-faceted approach to improve women’s health through research, policy, and advocacy.
The Opportunity
Working to support three emerging research leaders, the Research Assistant will sit primarily within the Global Women’s Health Program and is required to support research and advocacy work as well as well as taking responsibility for administrative duties.
This role is suitable for graduates and/or postgraduates interested in taking the first step into a research career. Our work is focussed on improving health and equity, particularly for women and underserved populations. There is good potential for the right candidate to progress to a Master’s or PhD related to this work.
Duties and Key Responsibilities
Collating study materials and drafting copy for peer-reviewed journal articles relating to the above work
Provide administrative and technical support to the study team
Conduct literature searches and assist with the preparation of grant applications
Assist with ethics applications and documentation
Communicate with study sites and respond to queries
Assist with study tracking and documentation
Assist in the distribution of study documents to Investigators
Assist with planning, organising and minuting regular meetings
Assist with the preparation of study-related presentation materials
Maintain up to date participating centre’s information (including all contact details, contracts and reports)
Data entry, ensuring data quality, accuracy, completeness and timeliness of data completion
Preparing paperwork required by the study and any study materials
Managing effective communication with the key stakeholders (participants, clinicians and investigators)
Assist with the preparation of reports and publications about research projects as required
Other ad hoc project work as required
Skills, Knowledge and Experience
Tertiary qualifications in a health or science discipline
Passionate about improving health and health equity for women worldwide
Excellent interpersonal and written communication skills with demonstrated ability to work respectfully across cultures and time zones
Experience in quantitative and/or qualitative research methods; experience in basic statistical analysis, systematic literature searching and/or writing literature reviews would be a huge advantage
Extremely well organised and a team player, with the ability to multitask, take initiative and follow up independently
Demonstrated ability to deliver high-quality work i.e. methodical, systematic and with excellent attention to detail
Proficient in the use of the Microsoft Office suite of products, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook

With the ever-increasing diversity of workflows that we run on the data, it has become essential to ensure that our data is not only efficiently stored (from a cost point of view), but that we can reliably and predictably recompute the data at very regular intervals.
Monitoring data usage and finding ways to store and access data in the most cost effective ways is therefore crucial. As different strategies are required based on data access patterns, you’ll have the opportunity to work closely with the Garvan IT department and the individual research groups to translate their project requirements into rigorous data management policies and lifecycles.
The policies and best practices you’ll define will have impact across the various centres and research groups around the Garvan, including the newly established Centre for Population Genomics (CPG) and the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics (KCCG).

Gain a solid understanding of the code base for one or more production machine learning models and data pipelines built with Python, SQL, Apache Spark and deployed on Google Cloud Platform. If you notice any bugs to fix, you’ll do it proactively.
Look for ways to introduce automation - which could involve small enhancements to code, investigating or adding new features to a model or optimising / performance tuning of models
Assisted a senior data scientist to scale a model using kubernetes or kubeflow - so it is easier to move into production and scale from X million customers to 5X million customers
Another squad may see you develop APIs to help other analytics or technology teams in the business consume and use your data science products
The datasets this teamwork on are huge, so typical tools of the trade will be Python, SQL, Spark, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes / GKE / Kubeflow, APIs and more from day one!

You will definitely need full, unrestricted Australian work rights and you will be based in Sydney
Heavy preference will be given to good commercial experience with data science using real customer data for big companies or start-ups
Availability preferred to be 1-4 weeks, no relocation or visa sponsorship is available

What will set you apart from all the other applicants?

We will first look at your commercial experience - where have you worked? What have you have built and how you communicate that in your CV and Cover Letter.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!"

ABOUT YOU

After some years building your skills in data engineering, you levelled up and gained the creds you needed to become a data architect. Now, having delivered a number of key data architecture designs and solutions implementations for large enterprise clients, or internally within a large enterprise, you are seeking a new challenge. You want a senior architecture role that blends your technical prowess with your entrepreneurial spirit; an opportunity to demonstrate your broad product and solutions knowledge in highly consultative engagements with senior stakeholders across multiple clients.

You are energised by some pretty geeky topics of debate, and have balanced views on subjects like:

what are the advantages and disadvantages of open source versus proprietary solutions
which cloud storage and data warehousing options suit best for which client situations
how to balance the need for regulatory compliance, data governance and data science agility
the pros / cons of various reporting, BI, analytics and data science tools and platforms
how businesses can surface and consume unstructured data to better serve their customers

Tell us what you believe the main reasons that businesses fail to deliver on their data and analytics strategy are, and what you would do differently to help clients avoid those mistakes?

You are able to interrogate business requirements deeply, and form a view as to how best to ingest, integrate, curate and conform streams from multiple data sources into cloud storage ready for syndication. You design data models in readiness for analysts and data scientists to extract insight and business value from the data you have surfaced, appreciating the nuance in how that data must be prepared, used, and made available between BI and ML workloads.

You know you are a craft leader and domain expert, and now you are looking for that rare opportunity to prove your craft and grow your creds across multiple industry categories.

Professional qualification(s) or credentials in enterprise and/or data architecture

Ecologists & Graduate Ecologists
Advertiser:
Ecotone Flora Fauna Consultants
Location:
Weipa, Cape York, Queensland
Salary etc:
Contracted Full-Time positions 2021
Overview
We are seeking highly motivated and capable ecologists or graduate ecologists to join our field team in Weipa, Cape York Peninsula to undertake field surveys in the area. The position would begin with a FIFO probationary period of three months for the candidate and business to decide if a permanent relocation to the Weipa lifestyle is desirable.
The roles and tasks are largely fauna-focussed and centred around our region of Cape York, so the candidates should have a keen interest in quickly learning the species of our region. A tertiary qualification in Ecology or similar is the desirable requisite for these positions. Previous consulting experience is not essential but would be advantageous for the Ecologist positions.
Applicants should be available to commence the position no later than February 2021.
The successful applicant/s should have an established high level of fitness and endurance to be able to hit the ground running, and the ability to work in the difficult conditions presented by this area including high temperatures and humidity and rough terrain and vegetation. This is not a position for the faint hearted or office oriented person but will be highly rewarding for a suitably fit, robust and motivated ecologist who has a true passion for field ecology in a remote part of Australia. The successful applicant will possess the ability and commitment to work within the Ecotone and clients’ safety systems, and also have demonstrated experience and abilities to operate 4WD vehicles and work safely within remote bush landscapes, including from bush camps if necessary.
The role is a contracted full-time position through to the end of 2021 with potential for a subsequent permanent appointment subject to performance and demonstrated skills during the initial appointment.
The Role
The role comprises on-going field work throughout the year, interspersed with office time to manage and analyse data, compile and submit reports. Field work will be predominantly pre-clearing surveys comprising tasks including camera surveys for mammals (northern quoll, black-footed tree-rat, chestnut dunnart) and systematic searches for breeding habitat of threatened birds (red goshawk, palm cockatoo, masked owl); but the role will also provide assistance to threatened species monitoring and/or research projects, baseline survey work and other projects as necessary. You will be involved in both Weipa based and occasionally more remote field work for Ecotone Projects.
You will be working as part of a small team based in Weipa that has an excellent work ethic and safety record and is focussed on safely delivering high quality Project outcomes for our clients.
Duties include:
Field-based work – Conduct field surveys of flora and fauna using a variety of techniques and methods. Field work will be mostly Weipa-based but may include remote work and trips based out of bush-camps. Field work includes:
Prepare vehicles for field work and conduct weed washdowns.
Compiling field equipment prior to surveys and checking all required gear is included.
Re-charging and maintaining electronic equipment and batteries
Demobilise vehicle and equipment and sign equipment back into office
Undertake navigational tasks and in field data entry to toughpads
Perform safely and follow all safety procedures
Produce and send out Comms Plans for all field work events
Ensure that all safety documents are on hand for the work and all safety requirements have been completed. Ie. vehicle checks
Professionally and proficiently conduct the actual field work program
Liaise professionally with clients on site and in the field where necessary
Work within and contribute to safety systems – This requires a willingness to work within Ecotone and client safety systems to ensure safe work practices. You will be required to contribute to the development of Job Safety Analysis documents for work tasks and Communication plans for remote field work. Participation in safety meetings is a necessity.
Data Review, Analysis & Management – Usually this is a matter of following a set procedure. In your role you will be required to uphold the procedures used in the business, seek out the procedures you need for your work or ask for assistance when required, and at time assist with developing new or improved methods and procedures for data management. The integrity of our data is paramount to the quality of our work and always needs to be maintained.
Review of survey/monitoring camera images – For some projects such as palm cockatoo hollow monitoring this task can be very monotonous, but the data we obtain from it is world-first and industry-leading in protecting a very vulnerable and iconic species. For other reviews such as images from quoll camera surveys, the opportunity to get paid to look for wildlife on cameras is something many of the higher-level staff wish they could still do. Regardless of what review work you are doing, you are expected to be diligent in your review, and in your data entry, as mistakes are time-consuming and costly to rectify, if they can ever be identified at all.
Performing Project Manager or Team-Leader duties – depending on the role of appointment, management responsibilities may include leading field work, monitoring and managing Project resourcing and time allocations to different tasks; scheduling work, liaising with clients; providing updates on Project progress to senior managers; and tasking junior staff with aspects of the project to distribute workloads.
Preparing Project reports and other communication to clients - you will be required in this role to write reports and present the data from field work projects to the client/s in a concise and accessible manner. These will include written reports, memos, emails and verbal reports on works. You may also be required to conduct literature reviews or research on various topics. Depending on your report writing-experience, your reports will be peer-reviewed and you will receive feedback so that you can develop your reporting and writing skills.
Permitting tasks – occasionally you may be asked to assist in preparation of permit applications and with reporting and data compilation for permitting returns.
Support – you will need to work closely with the Business Managers and other Graduate Ecologists, Ecologists, Senior Ecologists and Project Managers to conduct your projects and align them with other work running concurrently within the business. You will receive support in your role from the Managers, but also your team-mates.
Managing a discrete area of the business such as permits, or equipment – you may be asked to take responsibility and management for a particular area of the Ecotone business.
Areas of Specialisation – it is good to be able to recognise an employee’s particular interests, talents and experience, so that both the employee and the employer can get the most out of the engagement. Whenever possible, your interests and special skills will be recognised to place you in roles that engage you and keep you keen in your position.
General application of oneself to work – in general, a willingness to learn, a good work ethic, team-focus and a strong initiative to identify the tasks and get the tasks done are what is desired most from this role. In return the business hopes to provide professional growth opportunities and job satisfaction.
The Successful Applicant
In order to successfully carry out this role you must have a passion for field ecology and be motivated to undertake field work in challenging tropical conditions. You must have a high level of physical fitness and mental resilience to enable you to safely carry out extended survey programs typically requiring walking long distances each day in difficult conditions.

Founded in 1963, Garvan’s mission is to harness all the information encoded in our genome to better diagnose, treat, predict and prevent disease.
Our scientists work across five intersecting research themes: medical genomics, epigenetics and cellular genomics; diseases of immunity and inflammation; cancer; and diseases of ageing affecting bone, brain and metabolism. In addition, three major Centres: The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, the Garvan-Weizmann Centre for Cellular Genomics, and the Centre for Population Genomics.
The Genomics and Epigenetics Theme is an integrated series of strongly interactive Research Groups undertaking research aimed at understanding genome biology and its impact on disease. The Theme's vision is to interpret the information encoded within the genome and elucidate how the patterns of spatial and temporal epigenetic and resulting transcriptional processes control human development.

It operates as a leading international centre for interdisciplinary, engaged and collaborative scholarship in the humanities and social sciences for a digital age. Research at the Institute for Culture and Society is organised around an integrated program of research focusing on a number of broad themes including cities and economies, digital life, diversity and globalization, heritage and environment.

The Institute is one of four Research Institutes at the University, and the only one predominantly focused on the discipline area of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS). An important role of the Institute is to help develop the University’s overall research performance through external income generation and high-quality publications. It also conducts profile-raising activities through organising major conferences, developing a network of similar research entities nationally and internationally, hosting visiting scholars, and forging strategic partnerships with external organisations and communities. Public and community engagement is an integral aspect of the Institute’s work. The Institute for Culture & Society hosts the Western Sydney University node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.

The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S) (http://admscentre.org.au) is a new, cross-disciplinary, and national research centre, which aims to create the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical, and inclusive automated decision-making. Funded by the Australian Research Council from 2020 to 2026, ADM+S is hosted at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia, with nodes in eight other Australian universities (Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, QUT, Swinburne University, University of Sydney, University of NSW and Western Sydney University).

Who is CHE Proximity
More than ever before the medium, the message and it's sequencing are inseparable from each other.
Unlike any time in history, connecting the medium, the message, and its sequencing to the consumer is more vital than ever.
Connected creativity is the synchronization of strategic positioning, engaging creative, combined with the next generation of engagement planning to ensure ideas create the cut-through needed to deliver the strongest commercial performances. Today, creativity cannot be left to chance. One brand expression or big TV ad is simply not enough.
More than ever, brands need to live in culture and our consumers worlds, allowing audiences to not only consume brands, but take part in owning, creating and amplifying them. To do this, the role of influencers, publishers, the news and bought media are inseparable from each other and the expression of the idea itself. To create such work, the classic disciplines of the marketing mix – advertising, experience, PR, CRM, media, digital – must all be unified, removing P&Ls, biases and incumbency to reveal a new breed of agnostic agency, resulting in connected creativity.
At CHE Proximity, we see this as the shift from brand as advertising to brand as experience. It is as profound a change in advertising as the printing press was to the democratisation of information. We are investing our every effort into leading this transformation and in doing so, supporting the sustainability of our cherished industry as an essential ingredient of modern commerce.
This is what we call Connected Creativity.

The Melbourne Sexual Health Centre at Alfred Hospital and Monash University offers a fully funded PhD scholarship in Sexual Health. We are looking for talented students with a strong interest in novel intervention to prevent and control sexually transmitted infections.
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major threat to public health and result in an extensive global burden of disease, including in Australia. The World Health Organisation estimates that there are about 1 million new diagnoses of curable STIs every day. Syphilis has been prevalent among gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (MSM) in Australia. Digital anal examination has been recommended for anal cancer screening among people living with HIV aged 50 years or above. It is hypothesised that digital anal examination may also be useful for early detection of anal symptoms related to STI, particularly syphilis. The PhD student will lead a series of clinical studies and trials to evaluate the effectiveness of digital anal examination for syphilis prevention.

Parfait is a static program analysis tool that finds bugs in C/C++, Java, and PL/SQL codebases at compile time, without having to execute the programs. Parfait is used internally in Oracle to detect many common types of programming errors before they are committed into Oracle's products.


Parfait Post-mortem is an extension of Parfait that scans a core dump in order to detect possible root causes of a crash. The goal is to reduce the time to resolve crashes by reusing Parfait program analysis infrastructure to scan the program and the provided runtime information prior to the crash.


The aim of this project in particular is to detect programming ""runtime smells"" using static analysis and data collected from a crash dump. A runtime smell is a suspicious set of runtime values that could be the cause of the crash. An example of a runtime smell would be a negative integer used as an index of an array.

Moreton Bay College (MBC) and Moreton Bay Boys’ College (MBBC) are two separate PP-12 single sex Uniting Church day schools.

Moreton Bay College was established in 1901 as a school for girls from PP-12 and now supports an enrolment in excess of 1100 students.

With 115 years of history, the College is well established with extensive libraries, sports, state-of-the-art music and performance centre, an Olympic sized swimming pool and a chapel. In 2014, the College completed a state-of-the-art Science Centre, featuring eight laboratories, a growth room and four experimental investigation rooms.

Moreton Bay Boys’ College established in 2003 to provide a boys-only school that could replicate the culture and ethos of MBC and provide an equivalent educational experience for boys in the local area. MBBC is an International Baccalaureate World school, which offers a globally-focussed approach to education that connects boys with the world around them. While still young in its history, MBBC campus is set among rich historic bushlands. Set within 13 hectares of native plants, MBBC has the perfect environment to foster learning.

Located within Physiotherapy at Austin Health, in Heidelberg, the research team of Professor Berlowitz examines sleep and breathing dysfunction in neuromuscular disease, especially in motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The research program works closely with the Victorian Respiratory Support Service (VRSS) within the Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, the state-wide service that provides domiciliary ventilatory support for over 1,000 individuals. Our research encompasses epidemiology and cohort studies, sleep and respiratory discovery experiments, especially upper airway physiology and imaging, controlled clinical trials, disease registry development, health systems research and health data analytics. Our research involves
collaboration across disciplines, technologies and countries.

The research team have recently finished a large body of work and are building capacity for future research. As part of this capacity building and development, Professor Berlowitz was recently awarded a Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant; A multi-centre randomised controlled trial of polysomnographic titration of non-invasive ventilation in motor neurone disease. The grant will support the completion of a randomized controlled, assessor-blinded trial in 7 motor neurone disease care centres across Australia.

Under the direction of the project and laboratory leader Professor David Berlowitz, a Trial Manager will be employed to assist with management of the research arising from the above-mentioned grant opportunity. The Trial Manager will be integral in managing and driving the program of research.

The position will entail providing strategic oversight of the project implementation and management activities, including management of
collaborators and the broader Australia-wide team. The Trial Manager will assist with data collection, analysis, preparation of publications and presentations for scientific meetings. This role requires an enthusiastic, independent and motivated individual, with exceptional teamwork skills and a desire to contribute to an exciting program of research. This position is primarily located in Heidelberg; however, being a multi-centre trial across Australia, some of the development and evaluation of interventions will occur in alternative settings, so travel to these locations will likely be necessary.

We foster a values-based culture of innovation and creativity to enhance the research performance of the University and to achieve excellence in teaching and research outcomes. We invest in developing the careers and wellbeing of our students and staff and expect all our leaders to live our values of:

Collaboration and teamwork

Respect

Software Engineer/Data Engineer,Nearmap,Barangaroo NSW,https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=88a9ed3b518e3529&fccid=fd991841e140b85f&vjs=3,None,None,"At Nearmap, we have petabytes of high quality aerial imagery (covering half a million square kilometres a year at 5-7cm resolution, and regularly captured imagery back to 2009). We produce automated 3D models of entire cities, and have recently launched our new product, Nearmap AI, which turns our visual content into semantic information to power decisions in a wide range of organisations. As a publicly listed company focussed on growth, we have both the resources to allow you to succeed in your role, and the agility (thanks to cloud-based infrastructure) to rapidly take advantage of the latest developments in the field. Nearmap is continually evolving, and you’ll need to thrive in a fast paced environment that changes rapidly.

A bit more about the culture…

At Nearmap, every voice matters, our business model partnered with our open-door management style gives you the opportunity to make an impact. Our Nearmappers see the world differently and are intently focused on delivering the best location content in the world. Having a shared goal and a lot of fun reaching it is how our Nearmappers truly flourish at their home away from home. We're all super down-to-earth - except when we're in the sky capturing fresh imagery!

In this role…

You’ll be designing, building and operating software systems that manage petabytes of data, as we transform imagery with deep learning, and human expert labelling systems in the loop. Operating almost exclusively on cloud native technologies (primarily AWS and Kubernetes), you’ll make heavy use of technologies like Kafka, gRPC, REST APIs and other modern data management and storage tools. So it’s a data engineering role, but a hugely complex one that operates well outside the standard categorical data / ETL flows that happen in many organisations.

You will work with an incredibly passionate and talented team of Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers, and your work will interface with systems that run tensorflow on thousands of GPUs, and train large deep learning models with novel architectures. For the right candidate, your core passion will be the data systems rather than the machine learning itself.

You will report to the Principal Machine Learning Engineer who runs our Data Engine team within the AI Systems group. The team mixes data science, ML engineering and software engineering, and has responsibility for building the systems and managing the data for human expert labelling of our imagery, and support the training and management of our deep learning models. We have a custom labelling environment built on our Map Browser product that allows our labelling team to annotate 2D, 3D and source imagery. We use algorithms in the loop to enhance the human labelling of millions of images, and automatically produce training data sets for ML that continually grow and improve in quality. We also facilitate the creation of new labelling projects, as we seek to build a richer machine learning derived picture of our physical world.

More about what you need to bring…

We're after an exceptional candidate, who has real world experience but is still eager to learn.

The main attributes we're after are:
Pragmatism: While deep knowledge of software engineering best practices is highly valued, pragmatism wins over elaborate theory when it comes to shipping products that work.
Collaboration: We believe working on AI is a team sport, and are after candidates who can communicate well, share knowledge, and be open to taking on ideas from anyone in the team. Having worked on shared code-bases in a commercial environment is mandatory, but it's the attitude that matters most.
Mandatory Technical Skills:
Production data systems (databases, unstructured data stores, pipelines etc.)
Cloud technologies
Python (application development, not just scripting!)
REST APIs (and gRPC)
Highly Valued Skills:
Kubernetes & Docker
Golang
Stream processing (ideally including Kafka)
Working with terabytes or petabytes of semi/unstructured data in a data warehouse or lake setup.
Education and Experience: At minimum, a technical bachelors level degree (engineering, computer science, etc.), with a few years of experience beyond that.
Attention to detail: Showing attention to detail when it counts is important... to be considered for this role, [click this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4janrzqgfxn61l/test.tar.gz?dl=0) and apply some basic data science skills (an astute software engineer should be able to solve it quickly with a little googling!).

Your Day to Day…

Designing and developing highly available and performance-critical APIs.
Building and managing microservices and data processing workload in Kubernetes environments.
Leading designs of major software components and systems.
Driving adoption of best practices in code health, testing, and maintainability.
Designing, developing, testing, deploying, maintaining and improving software.
Supporting production systems.
Working closely with wider Engineering team and contributing to improvement initiatives.
Championing & assisting with implementation of labelling infrasture, data management and discovery systems.

Some of our perks include…

Competitive pay, Bonus plan and Employee Share Scheme
Flexible working environment, work life balance is a necessity
Opportunities for continued career growth and development
Ergonomic workstations with sit stand desks
Well-being program including an allowance to help focus on your well-being
Volunteer days
Free reign of Nearmap products

Computational Biologist,The Garvan Institute of Medical Research,Sydney NSW,https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=60b13eb6360a9b34&fccid=196a0f3231976ff2&vjs=3,5.0,None,"The Garvan Institute of Medical Research brings together world-leading clinicians and basic and translational researchers to break down barriers between traditional scientific disciplines and find solutions to disease. Founded in 1963, Garvan’s mission is to harness all the information encoded in our genome to better diagnose, treat, predict and prevent disease.
Our scientists work across four intersecting research themes: medical genomics, epigenetics, and cellular genomics; diseases of immunity and inflammation; cancer; and diseases of ageing affecting bone, brain and metabolism. Garvan also has three major Centres: The Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, the Garvan-Weizmann Centre for Cellular Genomics, and the Centre for Population Genomics.
This position will be based in the Centre for Population Genomics, a new collaborative initiative of Garvan and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) in Melbourne. The Centre for Population Genomics is focussed on the development of cutting-edge tools and resources to facilitate the conversion of genomic data into improved diagnosis and treatment for Australians, the field known as genomic medicine. Ultimately the Centre will generate and manage the largest sets of genomic and clinical data ever assembled in Australia, and apply these to solve a wide variety of scientific and medical problems. The Centre’s staff will operate from two physical sites: Garvan in Sydney, and MCRI in Melbourne.
The Director of the Centre for Population Genomics, Dr Daniel MacArthur, previously led a team at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Boston that was responsible for the development and open release of the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a collection of genetic data from over 140,000 individuals that has become one of the most widely-used reference databases in human genetics.
The Opportunity
We are seeking Computational Biologists at a variety of levels of seniority to contribute to the development of novel analysis pipelines for large-scale genomic datasets, to apply these pipelines to increasingly large human genomic data sets, and to work closely with other Centre staff and external researchers to carry out and publish novel analyses of the data. Computational Biologists will join a highly collaborative team including other analysis and methods development staff, software engineers, project managers, communities specialists, and trainees.
These Computational Biologist positions will be part of the Centre’s Analysis Team, which will be responsible for developing scalable pipelines for complex genomic analyses, for working closely with the Centre’s software development team to implement these at production scale across data from tens of thousands of individuals, and for performing quality control and analysis across the resulting data sets. This team will be composed of members with diverse skills across computational biology, statistical genetics, and population genetics, working collaboratively to create these pipelines, perform analyses, and contribute extensively to the publication of high-impact science.
While these positions will involve direct exposure to cutting-edge genomic science, the measures of success and promotion will be on developing and deploying complex analysis methods at scale, and not on traditional academic metrics such as leading publications. These positions are centrally funded and are not dependent on fellowships or other fundraising.

PhD Scholarship in BAE IMCRC Narrative Visualisation,University of South Australia,South Australia,https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=be6f696a0eef3c05&fccid=e20fe9808db75620&vjs=3,4.3,"$37,285 a year","PhD scholarship position in lmmersive Analytics and Data Storytelling
The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants
$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension


About the scholarship

The University of South Australia is welcoming applications for a PhD position in lmmersive Analytics and Data Storytelling to work on the project ""Application of Narrative Visualisation and Big Data to Improve High Value Manufacturing"" funded by BAE Systems and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.

The successful applicant will explore and develop visualisation and data storytelling systems in immersive environments-including virtual reality, augmented reality, and tabletop displays-to elucidate insight in advanced manufacturing environments. Manufacturing in Defence inherently relies on participants in the supply chain performing at a very high-quality level without full visibility of what is happening elsewhere in the chain. Human-in-the-loop decision making is fundamental in high value complex manufacturing, both to correct defects and increase operational efficiency. The problem is a latency of presenting appropriate data to the critical decision makers. Data captured from disparate Industry 4.0 technologies can be transformed into a trusted data driven decision support tool, based on big data and smart visualisation techniques.

The successful applicant should have an outstanding academic record and a background in information visualisation and XR technologies. The applicant should have both strong computer science skills and design skills. The applicant will be part of a team of visualisation, data, and artificial intelligence experts and working closely with stakeholders at BAE to address real-world issues faced by advanced manufacturing.

The successful applicant will be based in the Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments (IVE). As a world leader in augmented reality and virtual reality, our researchers are leaders in many areas of AR and VR research including wearable computing, interface design, empathic computing, 30 visualisation, perception, and telepresence. Our vast experience in advanced manufacturing, Internet of Things (loT), interactive art, and design for healthcare and defence allows us to work in collaboration with our industry partners to transform industry and solve large-scale societal challenges.

Eligibility

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements for a research degree program at the University of South Australia.

Candidates born in ITAR-proscribed countries and nationals of IT AR-proscribed countries are ineligible. Please check the list of denial countries in ITAR legislation at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/126.1 prior to applying.

Value

$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension. An additional $2,500 is available for equipment upon
commencement.

How to apply and closing date

In the first instance, interested applicants should send their CV and academic transcript to Dr Andrew Cunningham at Andrew.Cunningham@unisa.edu.au and following the initial endorsement by the supervisor, you will be required to go through the UniSA online application process.

Court Support Officer,Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Servic...,Rockhampton QLD,https://au.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=37c3f5f1a04fc7c1&fccid=88f17fe7ec5d75a3&vjs=3,None,None,"Purpose of the role
Interact
with clients in a manner which provides them with a knowledge and understanding
of the criminal justice system and their rights within it. Assist legal staff
in providing a service that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of
clients.

This role encourages a personable,
enthusiastic and organised social justice networker to provide support,
information and encouragement at a time when clients are often at their most vulnerable. The majority of our client-demand provides
excellent opportunity to work on the ground within the justice system – for
example, at court, visiting watch-houses and correctional facilities so as to
ensure that clients’ legal rights are protected.

Opportunity
You
will have frequent opportunity to provide information directly to clients, and
work with our staff team and external stakeholders. You can rely on the
State-wide resources of the Principal Legal Officer (PLO) and ATSILS’ Directors
of Law (Criminal, Civil and Family), outside of Brisbane with the Regional
Manager and the local legal team with whom you will work.

A
corporate services team based in Brisbane provides administrative, public
relations, and human resources support; locally, administration support with
management ensures a strong back-up is in place.

SELECTION CRITERIA
ESSENTIAL CRITERIA (6)
1. Values : alignment to the values and vision
of ATSILS and an appreciation of and sensitivity to the challenges our clients
have faced, and continue to face, in their fight for and their right to justice and equity.
2. Identified position* : be an Aboriginal
and/or Torres Strait Islander person who both identifies and is recognised as
such within the community from which he or she originates or currently resides.
ATSILS claims
exemption under the Queensland
Anti-Discrimination Act, Sections 25 (Genuine Occupational Requirement) and
104 (Welfare) in the identification of this role for Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander employees . (Indigenous
candidates of non-Australian cultures are not eligible for interview or
appointment.)
3. Core knowledge : demonstrated knowledge
of the criminal justice system; e.g. diversionary alternatives available,
client rights upon detention or arrest.
4. Client service and data management : post-court file management
paperwork responsibilities mean that sound administrative and computer-literacy
abilities are essential (e.g. Microsoft Office via a Windows network and use of the internet).
Demonstrated ability to professionally maintain a central diary of
commitments, use keyboard skills (typing) and keep files/administrative records
in order - plus strong oral and written skills are essential.
5. Confidence in providing timely assistance to clients : to those held in custody; to those attending court; and to those
seeking information over the phone, internet or by visiting offices. Further, a preparedness to work
varying shifts of duty including after hours (and on-call).
6. Mobility, access and safety : a current Queensland Driver licence and ability
to drive in all reasonable conditions; a willingness to undergo a Criminal Record Check to achieve a National
Police Certificate (Australia-wide
Disclosable Criminal History).
Entry to correctional/detention
facilities and watch-houses is an essential component of discharging a Court
Support Officer’s duties. Candidates may be required to disclose misconduct
(criminal convictions, prosecution investigations etc.,) that prevent an ATSILS
Security Clearance in relation to any conviction for fraud or other dishonesty
related criminal offences. To this end,
a preferred candidate must be prepared to consent to a C riminal History Check being conducted (if requested). A criminal
history does not automatically preclude selection for interview. A preliminary
check can be discussed with the Human Resources Manager after a candidate has
been shortlisted for interview.

DESIRABLE CRITERIA (4)
1. Current First Aid Certificate, Workplace Health and Safety Representative training or Emergency Services qualifications.
2. Database entry and reporting
skills highly regarded.
3. Qualifications in Legal Studies, Law, Social Sciences, Justice, Advocacy, Aboriginal or Torres Strait
Islander Community Development, Criminology, or current enrolment in any of
these tertiary courses.
4. Experience in working in an
Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander-owned community organisation."

Modern, world-class facilities
Convenient Randwick location, close to transport

Every year in Australia there are around 950 new children diagnosed with cancer. To improve the outcomes of children with cancer, the Children’s Cancer Institute (CCI) initiated the Zero Childhood Cancer national personalised medicine trial (PRISM). This trial aims to match patients to the optimal treatment guided by molecular tumour profiling, high-throughput in vitro drug testing on patient-derived model systems and in vivo drug validation in patient-derived xenograft models. The Bioinformatics group at CCI plays a crucial role in unravelling and understanding the molecular basis and drivers of a child’s tumour and is essential for the integrative analyses to link molecular profiling data to in vitro generated drug efficacy data for drug hit calling and prioritisation for individual PRISM patients and the identification of novel biomarker-drug efficacy associations for future patients.
As a key partner of the Zero Childhood Cancer program, the Translational Tumour Biology (TTB) group at CCI is deeply involved in the molecular profiling and drug analysis of the program and focusses on further understanding how altered genes drive cancer and on how to translate this knowledge into new clinically applicable treatment interventions. The TTB group believes that understanding the molecular mechanisms used by cancer driver genes is the key to more effective therapies with reduced toxicity.
Currently, we are looking for a strong and creative programmer with an eye for detail and a passion for biological research to:
Analyse high-throughput drug screening data within the PRISM trial
Develop an integrative data analyses platform for dynamic correlations between in vitro drug efficacy data and molecular profiling data

Responsibilities will include, but are not limited to:
Develop and optimize algorithms to analyse, visualise and summarise in vitro drug efficacy data generated within the national PRISM trial to support drug curation meetings in which drug screening results are shared and discussed with treating clinicians and other team members involved
Develop an integrative data analyses platform for dynamic correlations between in vitro drug efficacy data and molecular profiling data
Develop and implement algorithms using omics data and in vitro efficacy data to predict effective drug combinations
Support spin-off research projects resulting from the precision medicine program
Support research projects and grant administrative activities of the Translational Tumour Biology group
Statistical analysis for clinical and bench-side research
Assess, understand and implement bioinformatics tools and generate bioinformatics pipelines
Teach, assist and mentor scientists in the field of bioinformatics
Any other tasks required by the team leader or delegated senior team members

Manager, Financial Reporting & Governance
Job Number: - AUS121160
Description
Deepen your expertise in the best function to learn about ANZ Business, Operations and Finance – all in the one role.
Have Exposure to Divisional Financial Controllers, Heads of Functions, Deputy CFOs, and Financial Policy Leads.
Be part of a really diverse, flexible, and innovative community, who enjoy the work process and have a strong sense of purpose.
About The Role
Role Location: 833 Collins Street, Docklands VIC 3008
Role Type: 12-month Fixed Term Contract, Full-time
As a Manager, Financial Reporting and Governance, you will be assessing the effectiveness of the key control activities that safeguard the integrity of Australia Retail & Commercial divisional reporting.
You will be meeting with various line managers and executives from Business, Risk, Finance, Operations and other Functions. You will be asking questions about the purpose and functions in their respective areas and how it impacts financial risks and reporting;
You will also be reviewing all kinds of documents to deepen your understanding – executive level papers as well as procedural guides. They will include Functional Risk Assessments, Divisional Risk Forum meeting notes, Risk Dashboards, Internal Audit Reports; but also, control operation procedures, system exception reports and issue summaries.
Based on the evidence obtained, you will be preparing governance deliverables, such as risk assessments, process narratives, test scripts, governance questionnaires and attestations which ultimately get reported to senior management and the Group Audit Committee.
You will periodically get involved in ‘business as usual’ Financial Control work, such as Annual Report preparation, accounting policy reviews, or deep dives on various finance matters.
Overall, you will have to examine a large body of evidence to form your professional opinion on state of financial controls and their impact on our external reporting.
About You
To be successful in this role, you will ideally have skills, knowledge and experience in the following:
You will be highly qualified in matters relevant to assurance functions and activities, testing of processes and controls and financial reporting. Usually it means that you have worked in a professional services firm, or Finance, Assurance or Internal Audit function in a large listed Corporate.
Proven work experience would be a good indicator of your expertise and reliability. If you have any cutting edge skills, like data science, programming, being a credit risk expert, or a data base modeler – this would make you a stand-out candidate;
You will be a member of Enterprise Finance, therefore we hope you will be interested in and familiar with Finance ecosystem: you will know about major financial developments in ANZ and in the banking industry; you have heard the latest from the AASB, read the AFR (sometimes) and see ANZ through the eyes of its owners and stakeholders. Recruiters call it a ‘commercial acumen’;
We are a lean governance team with a lot of work to do therefore we expect you to be confident, independent, risk-minded, able to challenge authority and exercise a healthy dose of professional skepticism. In other words, we see you as a governance partner, rather than an employee that needs to be directed at all times. Most importantly, you will have an open and curious mind, be able to get along with people and enjoy your job.
We want you to bring your own perspective and ideas about how our program is planned, executed and reported – so that the program can be continually developed and improved.
If you think this role sounds like a good fit, but you are not sure, or are uncertain about your qualifications, please apply anyway
About ANZ

Creativemass, through our flagship product, WealthConnect aims to revolutionise the delivery of Financial Services. WealthConnect has been designed with investors at its core. We believe that complex, proprietary, closed and costly systems are not required for advisors to provide good advice.

We successfully listed on the app exchange in early 2020 and are on track to becoming the fastest growing Salesforce backed ISV company in Australia.

We are looking to expand our Product Development team and are looking for highly motivated Salesforce Lightning Developers to grow with our company and contribute something new to our eclectic mix of personalities.
We have learnt that individuals that work best with us have the following traits:

You are adaptable and can deal with uncertainty
For us to be successful, we need to remain agile. We must constantly adapt to customer requirements and feedback.

It may mean that something you thought you were going to start working on next week has been reprioritised. You should be able manage changing priorities and be able to focus on the highest priority task for the team.
You embrace challenge and hard work
Building a product that revolutionises an industry is not easy. You must have a natural bias towards hard work and taking on new challenges. While this is something we will continually strive to minimise, there will be occasions where we will have to pull together a team and put in the extra effort to make sure we hit critical deadlines.
You roll up your sleeves when required
While development is a critical part of the Product Development value stream, without help from our colleagues, our product will not be successful. We are looking for individuals who may be developers by trade but are willing to roll up their sleeves when needed, to help test, clarify user requirements or fulfil some other team obligation.
Responsibilities

Keep on top of the latest best practice relating to Salesforce through trailheads, self-study and certifications.
Understand fundamental software development principles and how these principles translate to Salesforce DX.

You are able to put yourself in the user’s shoes and understand their current pain points.
You understand how to design systems that are easily understood and usable by users of varying levels of technical ability.
You are self-motivated and have a thirst for knowledge through self-certification and completion of trailhead modules.
You challenge the status quo and continuously strive for new and innovative ways to improve our ways of working and our product.

CSIRO Agriculture and Food and Western Sydney University (WSU) are offering a joint scholarship to a PhD candidate who has undertaken studies in agricultural science and plant biology. The student will work within a research team investigating genetics and physiology of sodicity tolerance in cotton.
Cotton is one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in Australia. The Australian cotton industry is known for high productivity and economic return, and has significantly contributed to the viability of many rural communities. Increasing cotton sodicity tolerance is of importance as much of Australia’s cotton is grown in sodic soils with a very high clay content and high pH. In such soils, excessive Na can impair cotton nutrient uptake and use, cause nutrient related stresses and reduce nutrient use efficiency. Consequently, limiting cotton productivity.
CSIRO cotton breeders have made significant progress identifying a leaf Na+ exclusion trait in cultivated tetraploid cotton species which has been bred into elite CSIRO germplasm and has potential to improve cotton sodicity tolerance. This project will investigate the inheritance and physiological mechanism of this trait and look at molecular markers applicable to its future fast-track breeding in cotton. The outcomes of this project will include new rapid screening tools for identifying and developing sodicity tolerant cotton, and new understanding on mechanisms of cotton sodicity tolerance.
During this project some of the tasks the student may undertake include:
Planning, preparing and conducting field, laboratory and glasshouse experiments at both CSIRO and WSU facilities.
Applying innovative approaches to testing and developing new cost-effective screening protocols for cotton tolerance to soil sodicitiy.
Collecting, processing and analysing plant materials, and undertaking phenotyping and genotyping in different experiments.
Collating, analysing and interpreting data using appropriate computer programs.
