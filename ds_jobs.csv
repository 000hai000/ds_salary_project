About Melbourne Law School:

Melbourne Law School (MLS) is Australia's first all-graduate law faculty. Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.
Dr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.

About the project:

Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.

About the role:

The successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.

About you:

Applications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview.
Indigenous Australians seeking support to apply for a vacancy are encouraged to contact the University by emailing their contact details and position number to law-hr@unimelb.edu.au

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants
$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension


About the scholarship

The University of South Australia is welcoming applications for a PhD position in Artificial Intelligence/Computer Science to work on the project ""Application of Narrative Visualisation and Big Data to Improve High Value Manufacturing"" funded by BAE Systems and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.

Discrete manufacturing in Defence inherently relies on participants in the supply chain performing at a very high-quality level without full visibility of what is happening elsewhere in the chain. Human-in-the-loop decision making is fundamental in high value complex manufacture, both to correct defects and increase operational efficiency. The problem is a latency of presenting appropriate data to the critical decision makers. Data captured from disparate Industry 4.0 technologies can be transformed into a trusted data driven decision support tool, based on big data and smart visualisation techniques.

The project seeks to develop novel artificial intelligence techniques for analysing and linking data across the supply chain and to create interactive decision support tools for advanced manufacturing in Defence. The successful applicant will develop novel artificial intelligence methods for linking and analysing data across a manufacturing supply chain.

The recipient should have an outstanding academic record and a background in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence.

Eligibility

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements for a research degree program at the University of South Australia.

Candidates born in ITAR-proscribed countries and nationals of IT AR-proscribed countries are ineligible. Please check the list of denial countries in ITAR legislation at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/126.1 prior to applying.

In the first instance, interested applicants should send their CV and academic transcript to Dr Wolfgang Mayer at Wolfgang.mayer@unisa.edu.au and following the initial endorsement by the supervisor, you will be required to go through the UniSA online application process.

We're looking for empathetic, curious and passionate people who are Full Stack Software Engineers to work in a young (as in business) start-up team. We're looking to build a new global technology company based around IoT tracking. We're working on construction right now but our intent is to expand that once we've nailed construction.
Why construction? Easy, construction is a massive global industry that still uses pen and paper in many cases. Right now it is an industry going through a revolution of technology and new ideas. Historically it's been seen as an industry with perennially low productivity and dangerous working conditions.
At Ynomia we are building IoT products that automate the capture of data in difficult construction environments (low power and no mobile reception) to help understand the status of a project. We then make meaning from the data we collect to help teams stay informed and improve the timeliness of decision-making. All so we can help construction teams manage information in real-time through an end-to-end IoT platform solution. They're glad we're here and we're happy to help.
Also, like a lot of good startups, there are so many ways this can go. I talk a lot about technology as a superpower. There's no point in the technology without the people you're trying to help. So here's a couple of super quick examples:
We track bins. Why? Because bins are a proxy for tidy sites (you're getting the good order vibe aren't you?) Tidy sites are safer sites. With 35 construction workers being seriously injured each day (see https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/construction) we clearly have a long way to go. We hypothesise that keeping track of the bins allows them to be emptied more efficiently and should create a virtuous cycle like better sites → less money spent on health and safety (as in payments to injured people) → more profitable sites → more incentive to make better sites.
We provide the real-time status of the critical path, high-value construction materials, like glass facades across the international supply chain. From their creation to their installation. Because you can't get electricians, plasterers doing their jobs until the building is sealed. So if you're a tradie you're very interested in when you need to be on-site and when you can do other things. If you work for a construction company we know that you stress about where those facades and you know that a blockage there can send the entire construction effort into panic mode. So you want to know what's going on with the facades too.
We track plant and equipment on an active job site. In this case, not only do we provide the realtime position of forklifts and scissor-lifts but we also are building safety compliance systems to automatically notify site teams of expiring inspections and unauthorized use.
Hopefully, you get the impression we're trying to create as many winners as possible. So our products have real value to the people who use them and the people who pay for them. And those are just the things we're doing right now. There are so many more stories to tell here.
We are building towards a vision that will create what we call the Connected Jobsite. An integrated platform to support construction teams with the location information of critical resource applications for plant and equipment, asset and machinery, safety and people, progress tracking and more...

Automated Decision-Making in Global Contexts, ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision- Making & Society (ADM+S). Institute for Culture and Society

About Us

The Institute for Culture and Society carries out research on the transformations in culture and society in the context of contemporary global change. It operates as a leading international centre for interdisciplinary, engaged and collaborative scholarship in the humanities and social sciences for a digital age. Research at the Institute for Culture and Society is organised around an integrated program of research focusing on a number of broad themes including cities and economies, digital life, diversity and globalization, heritage and environment.

The Institute is one of four Research Institutes at the University, and the only one predominantly focused on the discipline area of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS). An important role of the Institute is to help develop the University’s overall research performance through external income generation and high-quality publications. It also conducts profile-raising activities through organising major conferences, developing a network of similar research entities nationally and internationally, hosting visiting scholars, and forging strategic partnerships with external organisations and communities. Public and community engagement is an integral aspect of the Institute’s work. The Institute for Culture & Society hosts the Western Sydney University node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.

The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S) (http://admscentre.org.au) is a new, cross-disciplinary, and national research centre, which aims to create the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical, and inclusive automated decision-making. Funded by the Australian Research Council from 2020 to 2026, ADM+S is hosted at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia, with nodes in eight other Australian universities (Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, QUT, Swinburne University, University of Sydney, University of NSW and Western Sydney University).

The Centre brings together leading researchers in the humanities, social and technological sciences in an international industry, research and civil society network. Its priority domains for public engagement are news and media, transport, social services and health. The Centre of Excellence for ADM+S has four Research Programs: Data, Institutions, Machines and People and four Focus Areas: Health, Mobility and Transport, News and Media and Social Services .

The Role

Research Fellow for ADM in Global Contexts The Research Fellow will develop and collaborate on projects that explore the ways in which ADM is being integrated in different parts of the world.

Project(s) will explore the relative norms around privacy and personhood that shape ADM practices in different national contexts through case studies of innovations in ADM in global contexts that have been largely ignored in the dominant literature theorising AI, automation, robotics and ADM. Attending to one or more of the focus-area themes, the case studies will be used to identify differences and similarities between research on ADM in Australia, challenging our assumptions about how ADM operates around the world.

The Research Fellow will work with Professor Heather A Horst, the ARC CoE node leader at Western Sydney University and ICS Director. The position will conduct and manage primary research on the current practices and possibilities of automated decision-making in at least two globally-situated ethnographic contexts; publish research in high-quality outlets; engage and translate research with collaborators, international colleagues and industry partners; assist with project management and administration of project research; supervise research assistants and, where appropriate, co-supervise PhD students.

This research-focused role does not include a teaching load, but opportunities for developing and maintaining a teaching profile may be available during the course of the Research Fellowship.

Remuneration Package : Academic Level B $122,848 to $144,960 (comprising Salary $103,808 to $122,587 p.a., plus 17% Superannuation, and Leave Loading).

Located within Physiotherapy at Austin Health, in Heidelberg, the research team of Professor Berlowitz examines sleep and breathing dysfunction in neuromuscular disease, especially in motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The research program works closely with the Victorian Respiratory Support Service (VRSS) within the Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, the state-wide service that provides domiciliary ventilatory support for over 1,000 individuals. Our research encompasses epidemiology and cohort studies, sleep and respiratory discovery experiments, especially upper airway physiology and imaging, controlled clinical trials, disease registry development, health systems research and health data analytics. Our research involves
collaboration across disciplines, technologies and countries.

The research team have recently finished a large body of work and are building capacity for future research. As part of this capacity building and development, Professor Berlowitz was recently awarded a Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant; A multi-centre randomised controlled trial of polysomnographic titration of non-invasive ventilation in motor neurone disease. The grant will support the completion of a randomized controlled, assessor-blinded trial in 7 motor neurone disease care centres across Australia.

Under the direction of the project and laboratory leader Professor David Berlowitz, a Trial Manager will be employed to assist with management of the research arising from the above-mentioned grant opportunity. The Trial Manager will be integral in managing and driving the program of research.

The position will entail providing strategic oversight of the project implementation and management activities, including management of
collaborators and the broader Australia-wide team. The Trial Manager will assist with data collection, analysis, preparation of publications and presentations for scientific meetings. This role requires an enthusiastic, independent and motivated individual, with exceptional teamwork skills and a desire to contribute to an exciting program of research. This position is primarily located in Heidelberg; however, being a multi-centre trial across Australia, some of the development and evaluation of interventions will occur in alternative settings, so travel to these locations will likely be necessary.

We foster a values-based culture of innovation and creativity to enhance the research performance of the University and to achieve excellence in teaching and research outcomes. We invest in developing the careers and wellbeing of our students and staff and expect all our leaders to live our values of:

Collaboration and teamwork

If you are interested in employing UAVs, multispectral and LiDAR in extracting phenotyping parameters and understanding the underlying mechanism that governs crop yield, this PhD fellowship can be for you.
Understanding the interaction of genotype with the environment is of prime importance, which can be achieved by the measurement of phenotypic traits of the crop. The field of phenomics is a large-scale collection of data-set to study, analyze and understand the interaction of genomic variations with the varying environment by revealing the relation between genotype and phenotypes. Traditionally, plant phenotyping has been achieved by manually collecting the data from the plants to select the best performing genotype. Technological advancement in the plant phenotyping has been a topic of interest among interdisciplinary researchers in recent years. The efforts have been put into using and optimizing the available technologies to adapt to the need for plant phenotyping. From the perspective of non-invasive measurement of phenotypic traits, the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of UAV based multispectral, photogrammetric and LiDAR is promising.
Project Outline and Tasks
Your primary responsibilities will be to:
· Optimise multispectral, photogrammetric and LiDAR sensor systems integrated on UAV platforms for high-throughput field phenotyping in grain crops, considering factors such as data sampling rate, field-of-view, sensitivity and modalities required for sensor operation.
Identify best practises in data processing and analysis for plant phenotyping, including generation of point cloud metrices, vegetation and morphological indices, segmentation, voxelization, classification, and 3D reconstruction of crops.
Participate in scientific conferences and workshops as well as events in the area of plant phenotyping and remote sensing.
Publish your findings in scientific journals.
Qualifications
Candidates are required to have:
· A Masters or Bachelors in agricultural science, remote sensing, computer science, electronics, or similar.

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants
$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension


About the scholarship

The University of South Australia is welcoming applications for a PhD position in lmmersive Analytics and Data Storytelling to work on the project ""Application of Narrative Visualisation and Big Data to Improve High Value Manufacturing"" funded by BAE Systems and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.

The successful applicant will explore and develop visualisation and data storytelling systems in immersive environments-including virtual reality, augmented reality, and tabletop displays-to elucidate insight in advanced manufacturing environments. Manufacturing in Defence inherently relies on participants in the supply chain performing at a very high-quality level without full visibility of what is happening elsewhere in the chain. Human-in-the-loop decision making is fundamental in high value complex manufacturing, both to correct defects and increase operational efficiency. The problem is a latency of presenting appropriate data to the critical decision makers. Data captured from disparate Industry 4.0 technologies can be transformed into a trusted data driven decision support tool, based on big data and smart visualisation techniques.

The successful applicant should have an outstanding academic record and a background in information visualisation and XR technologies. The applicant should have both strong computer science skills and design skills. The applicant will be part of a team of visualisation, data, and artificial intelligence experts and working closely with stakeholders at BAE to address real-world issues faced by advanced manufacturing.

The successful applicant will be based in the Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments (IVE). As a world leader in augmented reality and virtual reality, our researchers are leaders in many areas of AR and VR research including wearable computing, interface design, empathic computing, 30 visualisation, perception, and telepresence. Our vast experience in advanced manufacturing, Internet of Things (loT), interactive art, and design for healthcare and defence allows us to work in collaboration with our industry partners to transform industry and solve large-scale societal challenges.

Eligibility

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements for a research degree program at the University of South Australia.

Candidates born in ITAR-proscribed countries and nationals of IT AR-proscribed countries are ineligible. Please check the list of denial countries in ITAR legislation at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/126.1 prior to applying.

Value

$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension. An additional $2,500 is available for equipment upon
commencement.

How to apply and closing date

In the first instance, interested applicants should send their CV and academic transcript to Dr Andrew Cunningham at Andrew.Cunningham@unisa.edu.au and following the initial endorsement by the supervisor, you will be required to go through the UniSA online application process.

This scholarship will remain open for applications until filled.

Access CSIRO’s world-class facilities and resources while completing your PhD
Apply for a CSIRO-WSU PhD Scholarship now!

CSIRO Agriculture and Food and Western Sydney University (WSU) are offering a joint scholarship to a PhD candidate who has undertaken studies in agricultural science and plant biology. The student will work within a research team investigating genetics and physiology of sodicity tolerance in cotton.
Cotton is one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in Australia. The Australian cotton industry is known for high productivity and economic return, and has significantly contributed to the viability of many rural communities. Increasing cotton sodicity tolerance is of importance as much of Australia’s cotton is grown in sodic soils with a very high clay content and high pH. In such soils, excessive Na can impair cotton nutrient uptake and use, cause nutrient related stresses and reduce nutrient use efficiency. Consequently, limiting cotton productivity.
CSIRO cotton breeders have made significant progress identifying a leaf Na+ exclusion trait in cultivated tetraploid cotton species which has been bred into elite CSIRO germplasm and has potential to improve cotton sodicity tolerance. This project will investigate the inheritance and physiological mechanism of this trait and look at molecular markers applicable to its future fast-track breeding in cotton. The outcomes of this project will include new rapid screening tools for identifying and developing sodicity tolerant cotton, and new understanding on mechanisms of cotton sodicity tolerance.
During this project some of the tasks the student may undertake include:
Planning, preparing and conducting field, laboratory and glasshouse experiments at both CSIRO and WSU facilities.
Applying innovative approaches to testing and developing new cost-effective screening protocols for cotton tolerance to soil sodicitiy.
Collecting, processing and analysing plant materials, and undertaking phenotyping and genotyping in different experiments.
Collating, analysing and interpreting data using appropriate computer programs.

Machine Learning Engineers here are engaged on specialist projects across the technology team. They are fairly autonomous; creating market advantage and providing clarity on what Machine Learning actually is to everyone else, and more importantly – what ML is not.
The ML Lead is tasked with galvanizing these very clever ML Engineers into one harmonious unit for the purpose of collaboration, R&D, building highly scalable systems and solving complex data challenges in what is a very high (volume and quality) traffic environment.
There are 8-10 core products (B2B and B2C) and everyone wants a slice of Machine Learning in there. You’ll ultimately decide where to best invest the units energy, accounting for both commercial impact and the units’ personal development objectives.  
The work done in this unit skews much more to the software elements of Machine Learning versus traditional Data Science; so a robust background in Computer Science and Programming is going to be critical to success.
The environment is run 100% on AWS, and most of the ML coding is done in Python with all the usual bits and bobs you’ll expect where Deep Learning, building data pipelines and deploying ML models into production are concerned.  
A contemporary leadership style is sought after, and you’ll be a beneficiary of such a style also. The Head of Technology (whom you’ll report to) has a phenomenal track record of enhancing leadership capability from within.
Stakeholder management is paramount, with your core running buddy being the Product Manager for Machine Learning. Expect to engage with peers across the business from Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Finance through to Commercial Sales.
The organization was fast to respond to Covid19 at a technical level, and is still operating in a 100% remote capacity. Flexibility post-Covid for WFH is a no brainer, as is there current opportunity to book office space for collaboration sessions (or face to face meetings). It has retained its lean product development culture from its startup days, but also comes with the right level of structure so people can stay in their lanes and get what they were hired to do done.

Startups often talk about AI or Machine Learning to drive personalisation; but they rarely have access to high quality first party data (10M+ records), the technical infrastructure, commercial nous or executive appetite to execute an ML strategy. 
Machine Learning Engineers and data analysts here are engaged on specialist projects across the technology team. They are fairly autonomous; creating market advantage and providing clarity on what Machine Learning actually is to everyone else, and more importantly – what ML is not.

You’ll ultimately decide which products to develop your analytics and machine learning engineering teams to, accounting for both commercial impact and the units’ personal development objectives.  
You will be driving the overall product strategy and working across the cross-functional stakeholders to bring clarity and prioritization to the businesses data strategy. 
What you’ll own 
Prioritising backlog and creating the product roadmap with key stakeholders 
Delivering on products that will shape the end user experience
Mentoring, coaching and collaborating with a team that includes strong UX, product manager and developers to shape the product culture.

The Role
You will be responsible for delivery of data analysis, reports, and dashboards to the new major project for the organisation.

Identify data collection and reporting requirements and develop data plans
Develop, define and manage database requirements
Perform and document procedures for data preparation including data cleaning, standardization, and analysis
Co-design solutions with project teams to address their data needs including defining requirements, analysing and presenting relevant client and provider data and insights.

Medium to high level knowledge and experience in SQL (T-SQL code and complex SQL queries).
Proven working experience as a data analyst, with the ability to collect, organise, analyse and disseminate significant amounts of information across project teams and stakeholders with attention to detail and accuracy
Extensive experience working directly with users, helping them understand how to harness the power of business intelligence, and efficiently build prototypes to demonstrate dashboard and reporting requests through data modelling, designing, and implementing a data warehouse.
In the 'nice to have' category we have a good understanding of Flask Python web app framework. Experience using statistical packages for analysing datasets (Excel or R) would be a plus, as would coming from a Primary Health Network or Health Industry environment. Ultimately though, it is your experience as a Data Analyst, plus your interpersonal skill set, values and drive, that will ultimately make you the right fit for this role.

QUT PhD scholarship in AI-based bone fracture detection and classification,Queensland University of Technology (QUT ),Brisbane,https://www.seek.com.au/job/51054325?type=standout#searchRequestToken=baa1a173-0011-49da-8f38-057c32874bd2,4.0 overall rating (187 employee reviews),$30000-$34999,"The Jamieson Trauma Institute (JTI, https://metronorth.health.qld.gov.au/jamieson-trauma-institute) represents a unique collaboration of service partners striving to advance trauma prevention, research, systems and clinical management, with the overall aim of delivering the best possible care to people suffering traumatic injuries treated at trauma centres across Queensland and Australia.
The JTI-funded PhD project is offered in partnership with Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and CSIRO scientists based at the Australian e-Health Research Centre (AEHRC) in Brisbane.
The project is building on the foundation of a funded pilot study conducted by the research partners multidisciplinary team. The successful candidate will have a unique opportunity to contribute to developing translational solutions aiming to optimise diagnosis and recommendation for treatment of orthopaedic trauma patients, with the overall goals to streamline treatment processes, reduce costs and limit patient radiation.
About the project and scholarship
AI-based fracture classification in orthopaedic trauma is a relatively new field. While the use of artificial intelligence to screen X-rays for fracture detection has been demonstrated, automatic fracture classification involves a higher level of complexity and moves a step further.
This project will investigate and develop novel methods utilising artificial intelligence that identify patients who exhibit a common pattern and may not require a CT scan. Once integrated in the hospital system, such a screening tool would streamline the treatment process, reduce CT scanning costs and minimise patient radiation.
The successful candidate will play a key role in the development and testing of artificial intelligence-based methods for detection and classification of bone fractures on clinical radiographic images.
A possible extension of the project is the virtual reconstruction of 3D models of bone fragments from routine 2D radiographs. Clinical image data will be available from the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (RBWH). The recipient will have the opportunity of working closely with clinicians at the RBWH and JTI, informatics specialists at AEHRC, and engineers at QUT.
An annual tax-free scholarship of $30,000 will be provided for 3.5 years of full-time study.
International students will receive an accompanying QUT Higher Degree Research Tuition Fee Sponsorship.
A project budget of up to $15,000 is available.
Eligibility and application criteria
Candidates must hold a first-class honours or masters degree with a significant research component, and be able to commence full-time study at QUT in Brisbane by 30 June 2021.
We are looking for a candidate with demonstrable experience in AI-methods and/or image processing from a variety of academic backgrounds including: computer science, electronic engineering, medical physics, medical engineering or related branches.

Automated Decision-Making in Global Contexts, ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision- Making & Society (ADM+S). Institute for Culture and Society

About Us

The Institute for Culture and Society carries out research on the transformations in culture and society in the context of contemporary global change. It operates as a leading international centre for interdisciplinary, engaged and collaborative scholarship in the humanities and social sciences for a digital age. Research at the Institute for Culture and Society is organised around an integrated program of research focusing on a number of broad themes including cities and economies, digital life, diversity and globalization, heritage and environment.

The Institute is one of four Research Institutes at the University, and the only one predominantly focused on the discipline area of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS). An important role of the Institute is to help develop the University’s overall research performance through external income generation and high-quality publications. It also conducts profile-raising activities through organising major conferences, developing a network of similar research entities nationally and internationally, hosting visiting scholars, and forging strategic partnerships with external organisations and communities. Public and community engagement is an integral aspect of the Institute’s work. The Institute for Culture & Society hosts the Western Sydney University node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.

The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S) (http://admscentre.org.au) is a new, cross-disciplinary, and national research centre, which aims to create the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical, and inclusive automated decision-making. Funded by the Australian Research Council from 2020 to 2026, ADM+S is hosted at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia, with nodes in eight other Australian universities (Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, QUT, Swinburne University, University of Sydney, University of NSW and Western Sydney University).

The Centre brings together leading researchers in the humanities, social and technological sciences in an international industry, research and civil society network. Its priority domains for public engagement are news and media, transport, social services and health. The Centre of Excellence for ADM+S has four Research Programs: Data, Institutions, Machines and People and four Focus Areas: Health, Mobility and Transport, News and Media and Social Services .

The Role

Research Fellow for ADM in Global Contexts The Research Fellow will develop and collaborate on projects that explore the ways in which ADM is being integrated in different parts of the world.

Project(s) will explore the relative norms around privacy and personhood that shape ADM practices in different national contexts through case studies of innovations in ADM in global contexts that have been largely ignored in the dominant literature theorising AI, automation, robotics and ADM.

The George Institute is 700+ people around the world, all focused on improving the health of millions of people worldwide. As a medical research institute affiliated with leading universities and with projects in approximately 50 countries, we are challenging the status quo in healthcare to:
Find better treatments for the world's biggest health problems
Transform primary health care to support better health for more people
Harness the power of communities, governments and markets to improve health
Our innovative commercial enterprises help maximise our impact. Please visit our website [link removed] to read more about how we are addressing the world's biggest health problems.
A scholarship is now available for a suitably qualified candidate, to undertake a 3.5 year PhD degree, based at The George Institute for Global Health and University of New South Wales. The scholarship stipend is $30,000 per year for 3.5 years and students will be supported to apply for competitive scholarship funding.
Even in advanced countries like Australia, where each citizen is granted equal access to healthcare, women and people with a less favourable socioeconomic status (SES), seem to be disadvantaged in cardiovascular disease management. Internationally, studies have shown that women receive poorer management of stroke compared to men, but comprehensive Australian data are limited.  While studies identified SES disparities in stroke incidence and mortality in Australia, these were all conducted more than 10 years ago and now out-of-date in the context of modern reperfusion therapy and evidence-based risk factor management. Contemporary data are needed to address any sex/SES disparities across the patient journey with acute stroke, from the time of onset of symptoms, initial assessment and use of acute treatments, and discharge from hospital with various secondary prevention treatment packages according to recommended guidlines.
The successful candidate will have strong interest in Big Data analytics. A good command of biostatistics and analysis software (eg SAS, STATA, R) would also be an advantage. They will be enthusiastic, well-organised, and have excellent oral and written communication skills, as evidenced by publications, including in peer-reviewed journals. An ability to work autonomously and to be self-directed in learning, as well as contributing to team activities and discussions, will be necessary for the successful completion of this PhD. Experience in conducting scoping and systematic reviews is desirable.

Brighton Primary School was established in 1875 and is situated in the Bayside suburb of Brighton, 12 kilometres from the CBD.  Brighton fronts Port Phillip Bay. With almost six kilometres of coastline within Brighton's suburban boundary, there is a diverse range of attractions and activities for all. The school has strong generational ties and is well supported by the School Council and parents. 
Brighton Primary School’s design is traditional and has approximately 29 classes organised in year levels.  Brighton Primary School has been redeveloped with attention to maintaining the architectural integrity of the two brick Victorian buildings and also has a large number of re-locatable buildings.  Generally, they are grouped in year levels to support our collaborative approach to learning and teaching and maximise the student playing space.  The school is fully air-conditioned, and all rooms are uniformly furnished to provide a familiar environment for students as they progress across the school.
Brighton Primary School has an enrolment of approximately 630 students, which includes 18 students with moderate to profound hearing loss enrolled in the regional Hearing Unit hosted at the school.

Our Outside School Hours Care program, TeamKids, is accommodated in the LOTE room and the Gym.
A variety of spacious and shaded areas that are landscaped provide a safe and well-equipped play area for students.

Below the junior play equipment is the Wonder garden, designed by our students.  It is both a teaching space and a playing area.

POSITION OVERVIEW: LOTE FRENCH TEACHER
Brighton Primary has a strong history of teaching a second language. We have currently completed a review of our current language program which saw Italian taught to students in Grade Prep to 4 then Chinese Mandarin taught to students in Grade 5 & 6. Our review showed that our community is in favour of a common language Grade Prep - 6 that supported a pathway through to secondary school. The review recommended that French be implemented Grade Prep to Grade 6 from 2021 onwards. Therefore, a key part of this role will be set up, build and launch this program, in collaboration with our existing language teacher.  The program will span Grade Prep to Grade 6 with a focus on both French language and culture.
The French teacher will demonstrate a high level of curriculum knowledge, quality teaching skills and successful application of assessment and reporting strategies appropriate for individual students in accordance with the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers.
ROLE
The classroom teacher classification comprises two salary ranges- range 1 and range 2.  The primary focus of the classroom teacher is on the planning, preparation and teaching of programs to achieve specific student outcomes.  The classroom teacher engages in critical reflection and inquiry in order to improve knowledge and skills to effectively engage students and improve their learning.
As the classroom teacher gains experience his or her contribution to the school program beyond the classroom increases. All classroom teachers may be required to undertake other duties in addition to their rostered teaching duties provided the responsibility is appropriate to the salary range, qualifications, training and experience of the teacher.
Classroom teacher Range 2
Range 2 classroom teachers play a significant role in assisting the school to improve student performance and educational outcomes determined by the school strategic plan and state-wide priorities and contributing to the development and implementation of school policies and priorities.
A critical component of this work will focus on increasing the knowledge base of staff within their school about student learning and high quality instruction to assist their school to define quality teacher practice.
Range 2 classroom teachers will be expected to:
Have the content knowledge and pedagogical practice to meet the diverse needs of all students
Model exemplary classroom practice and mentor/coach other teachers in the school to engage in critical reflection of their practice and to support staff to expand their capacity
Provide expert advice about the content, processes and strategies that will shape individual and school professional learning
Supervise and train one or more student teachers
Assist staff to use student data to inform teaching approaches that enable targets related to improving student learning outcomes to be achieved.
Classroom teacher Range 1
The primary focus of the range 1 classroom teacher is on further developing skills and competencies to become an effective classroom practitioner with structured support and guidance from teachers at higher levels and the planning, preparation and teaching of programs to achieve specific student outcomes. These teachers teach a range of students/classes and are accountable for the effective delivery of their programs.  Range 1 classroom teachers are skilled teachers who operate under general direction within clear guidelines following established work practices and documented priorities and may have responsibility for the supervision and training of one or more student teachers.
At range 1, teachers participate in the development of school policies and programs and assist in the implementation of school priorities.
The focus of a range 1 classroom teacher is on classroom management, subject content and teaching practice.  New entrants to the teaching profession in their initial teaching years receive structured support, mentoring and guidance from teachers at higher levels.
Under guidance, new entrants to the teaching profession will plan and teach student groups in one or more subjects and are expected to participate in induction programs and other professional learning activities that are designed to ensure the integration of curriculum, assessment and pedagogy across the school.

Performs and/or supervises tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice and school policy.  This may include the supervision and coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.  Supervision and coordination would be limited to ensuring routine tasks are performed to required standards.  Input into identifying training needs and development of education support class staff within the work area or educational program becomes an important feature at range 2.

Specialised support to achieve specific outcomes is a feature of range 2.  Typically this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the operation of a work area (e.g. managing the day to day operation of a school office) under the direction of the principal or another senior manager.

Provides support to teachers and students that is beyond the routine support provided at education support class Level 1, range 1.  Within an educational program assists teachers with the coordination of the support function, such as directing/organising the work of other support staff or providing a specialist support role. 

Undertakes medical intervention support tasks or other specialised student/teacher support roles that require specific training that must be updated from time to time.  The role is for a specific purpose for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.

Performs technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options.  Routine technical support in libraries, science and information technology laboratories would be typical examples.

An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.  Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee's position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.

The opportunity
Each year, approximately 300-400 newly incident cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) occur in Australia, resulting in a lifetime impact in terms of functional impairment, mental health of the individual and their family, and financial cost for the individual, the community, and the health system. Over 15,000 Australians currently live with SCI, with a total cost to healthcare systems amounting to more than $2B per year.

The BioSpine project aims to develop an integrated rehabilitation system that closes the brain-muscles-brain loop to restore movement and sensation in individuals with SCI. This works by combining multiple technologies into a single rehabilitation system, which includes brain-computer interfaces, rehabilitation robotics, electrical stimulation, drug therapy and extended reality feedback. A digital twin of the individual allows us to seamlessly interface these devices with the person, optimally adapting the rehabilitation. This integrated system was developed for the rehabilitation of people with spinal cord injury and it now requires further evaluation.

Mechanisms of treatment effect as well as clinical and economic outcomes will be assessed in a prospective longitudinal trial investigating the effectiveness of the intervention. Outcomes will include sensory, motor and autonomic nervous system assessments as well as other systemic and neurophysiological processes.

We are seeking a PhD candidate for whom the BioSpine intervention will be at the centre of their thesis. The candidate will be responsible for recruiting participants and implementing the training program as well as recording outcome assessments over time.

About you
We are looking for a PhD candidate to be part of a multidisciplinary team of engineers, industrial designers, and clinicians. The candidate should be highly organised, self-motivated, have demonstrated the capacity to undertake research to a PhD standard, and preferably have clinical experience in the field of spinal cord injury.

Successful candidates are expected to hold a bachelor's degree with first-class honours or second-class honours (Division A) or a Master's degree. These degrees should incorporate a significant research component (>33% of the total degree credit points) in either of exercise physiology, physiotherapy, exercise science, or related degrees.

Please refer to the following web page for eligibility requirements for entry into the program.

If you also wish to be considered for a scholarship, please refer to the following web page for scholarship and application tips . Selection of applicants for the award of a HDR scholarship involves consideration of your academic merit; research background; and the quality of the research training environment in which your research project will be undertaken, taking into account the alignment of the project with the University's strategic priorities.

About scholarship opportunities
The 2020 Griffith University Postgraduate Research Scholarship has an annual stipend of $28,092 (indexed) for a period of up to three years of full-time study. Please see the GUPRS Conditions of Award for more information.

What we offer
BioSpine is being developed by an interdisciplinary team lead by Prof David Lloyd, comprising researchers from Griffith University's Centre of Biomedical and Rehabilitation Engineering (GCORE), The Hopkins Centre and the Menzies Health Institute Queensland (MHIQ), located on the Gold Coast, as well as external collaborators from The University of Sydney and Harvard University. The team includes scientists, engineers, allied health professionals and industrial designers with strengths spanning spinal cord injury, other neuromusculoskeletal conditions, rehabilitation engineering, biomechanics, computational modelling, physiotherapy, exercise physiology, pharmacology, artificial intelligence and machine learning. This project provides an opportunity to significant contribute to the rehabilitation of spinal cord injury, with the intended outcomes of improving the quality of life of individuals with a disability.

This works by combining multiple technologies into a single rehabilitation system, which includes brain-computer interfaces, rehabilitation robotics, electrical stimulation, drug therapy and extended reality feedback. A digital twin of the individual allows us to seamlessly interface these devices with the person, optimally adapting the rehabilitation. This integrated system was developed for the rehabilitation of people with spinal cord injury and it now requires further evaluation.

Mechanisms of treatment effect as well as clinical and economic outcomes will be assessed in a prospective longitudinal trial investigating the effectiveness of the intervention. Outcomes will include sensory, motor and autonomic nervous system assessments as well as other systemic and neurophysiological processes.

We are seeking a PhD candidate for whom the BioSpine intervention will be at the centre of their thesis. The candidate will be responsible for recruiting participants and implementing the training program as well as recording outcome assessments over time.

About you
We are looking for a PhD candidate to be part of a multidisciplinary team of engineers, industrial designers, and clinicians. The candidate should be highly organised, self-motivated, have demonstrated the capacity to undertake research to a PhD standard, and preferably have clinical experience in the field of spinal cord injury.

Successful candidates are expected to hold a bachelor's degree with first-class honours or second-class honours (Division A) or a Master's degree. These degrees should incorporate a significant research component (>33% of the total degree credit points) in either of exercise physiology, physiotherapy, exercise science, or related degrees.

Please refer to the following web page for eligibility requirements for entry into the program.
