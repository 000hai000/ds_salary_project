This top data science team builds commercial analytics and machine learning solutions that have a big impact on a large amount of Australian customers. They’ve had excellent results and are growing to improve the scalability of models, extend their work and automate various aspects of their data and ML processes. 


What business problems does this team solve?

The team uses customer, sales transaction and digital data sets to provide better deals, offers and recommendations to customers and improve sales! They work across multiple squads and projects, but everyone is using machine learning to make marketing and customer experiences more personalised.  


If you were working for this team, here are some of the things you might have done in the last 6 months:
Gain a solid understanding of the code base for one or more production machine learning models and data pipelines built with Python, SQL, Apache Spark and deployed on Google Cloud Platform. If you notice any bugs to fix, you’ll do it proactively. 
Look for ways to introduce automation - which could involve small enhancements to code, investigating or adding new features to a model or optimising / performance tuning of models 
Assisted a senior data scientist to scale a model using kubernetes or kubeflow - so it is easier to move into production and scale from X million customers to 5X million customers
Another squad may see you develop APIs to help other analytics or technology teams in the business consume and use your data science products
The datasets this teamwork on are huge, so typical tools of the trade will be Python, SQL, Spark, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes / GKE / Kubeflow, APIs and more from day one! 

Sounds great, what skills and experience do you need to apply?!

Experience is important. The more you can demonstrate your abilities to do similar or transferable tasks or projects in a real business, the easier it will be. 
You need skills (1 to 5 years) in data science and are already a strong practitioner with; Python, SQL and Tree-based algorithms
At least a bachelor’s degree and our preference is in Computer Science, Software Engineering or a similar field (perhaps Aeronautical Engineering?) which combines strong numerical, data and technical skills - understanding data structures, algorithms, CI/CD, etc. 
We prefer if you have already used; Kubernetes or Kubeflow for containerisation of data science solutions and either GCP, AWS or Azure
You will definitely need full, unrestricted Australian work rights and you will be based in Sydney
Heavy preference will be given to good commercial experience with data science using real customer data for big companies or start-ups
Availability preferred to be 1-4 weeks, no relocation or visa sponsorship is available

What will set you apart from all the other applicants?

We will first look at your commercial experience - where have you worked? What have you have built and how you communicate that in your CV and Cover Letter. 

Due to volume, we will contact shortlisted candidates as soon as possible for more detailed interviews and briefings"

Machine Learning Engineers here are engaged on specialist projects across the technology team. They are fairly autonomous; creating market advantage and providing clarity on what Machine Learning actually is to everyone else, and more importantly – what ML is not.
The ML Lead is tasked with galvanizing these very clever ML Engineers into one harmonious unit for the purpose of collaboration, R&D, building highly scalable systems and solving complex data challenges in what is a very high (volume and quality) traffic environment.
There are 8-10 core products (B2B and B2C) and everyone wants a slice of Machine Learning in there. You’ll ultimately decide where to best invest the units energy, accounting for both commercial impact and the units’ personal development objectives.  
The work done in this unit skews much more to the software elements of Machine Learning versus traditional Data Science; so a robust background in Computer Science and Programming is going to be critical to success.
The environment is run 100% on AWS, and most of the ML coding is done in Python with all the usual bits and bobs you’ll expect where Deep Learning, building data pipelines and deploying ML models into production are concerned.  
A contemporary leadership style is sought after, and you’ll be a beneficiary of such a style also. The Head of Technology (whom you’ll report to) has a phenomenal track record of enhancing leadership capability from within.
Stakeholder management is paramount, with your core running buddy being the Product Manager for Machine Learning. Expect to engage with peers across the business from Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Finance through to Commercial Sales.
The organization was fast to respond to Covid19 at a technical level, and is still operating in a 100% remote capacity. Flexibility post-Covid for WFH is a no brainer, as is there current opportunity to book office space for collaboration sessions (or face to face meetings). It has retained its lean product development culture from its startup days, but also comes with the right level of structure so people can stay in their lanes and get what they were hired to do done.

The topic of this PhD research program is ‘Increasing outdoor physical activity whilst reducing plastic litter in neighbourhood and coastal areas’. Through the use of technologies (e.g. activity trackers, smartphone apps, social media, web) this PhD research program aims to engage children and families to increase their outdoor physical activity (walking, running, active play) whilst picking up plastic litter in neighbourhood and coastal areas.

The JTI-funded PhD project is offered in partnership with Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and CSIRO scientists based at the Australian e-Health Research Centre (AEHRC) in Brisbane.
The project is building on the foundation of a funded pilot study conducted by the research partners multidisciplinary team. The successful candidate will have a unique opportunity to contribute to developing translational solutions aiming to optimise diagnosis and recommendation for treatment of orthopaedic trauma patients, with the overall goals to streamline treatment processes, reduce costs and limit patient radiation.
About the project and scholarship
AI-based fracture classification in orthopaedic trauma is a relatively new field. While the use of artificial intelligence to screen X-rays for fracture detection has been demonstrated, automatic fracture classification involves a higher level of complexity and moves a step further.
This project will investigate and develop novel methods utilising artificial intelligence that identify patients who exhibit a common pattern and may not require a CT scan. Once integrated in the hospital system, such a screening tool would streamline the treatment process, reduce CT scanning costs and minimise patient radiation.
The successful candidate will play a key role in the development and testing of artificial intelligence-based methods for detection and classification of bone fractures on clinical radiographic images.
A possible extension of the project is the virtual reconstruction of 3D models of bone fragments from routine 2D radiographs. Clinical image data will be available from the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (RBWH). The recipient will have the opportunity of working closely with clinicians at the RBWH and JTI, informatics specialists at AEHRC, and engineers at QUT.
An annual tax-free scholarship of $30,000 will be provided for 3.5 years of full-time study.
International students will receive an accompanying QUT Higher Degree Research Tuition Fee Sponsorship.
A project budget of up to $15,000 is available.
Eligibility and application criteria

Automated Decision-Making in Global Contexts, ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision- Making & Society (ADM+S). Institute for Culture and Society

About Us

The Institute for Culture and Society carries out research on the transformations in culture and society in the context of contemporary global change. It operates as a leading international centre for interdisciplinary, engaged and collaborative scholarship in the humanities and social sciences for a digital age. Research at the Institute for Culture and Society is organised around an integrated program of research focusing on a number of broad themes including cities and economies, digital life, diversity and globalization, heritage and environment.

The Institute is one of four Research Institutes at the University, and the only one predominantly focused on the discipline area of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS). An important role of the Institute is to help develop the University’s overall research performance through external income generation and high-quality publications. It also conducts profile-raising activities through organising major conferences, developing a network of similar research entities nationally and internationally, hosting visiting scholars, and forging strategic partnerships with external organisations and communities. Public and community engagement is an integral aspect of the Institute’s work. The Institute for Culture & Society hosts the Western Sydney University node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.

The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S) (http://admscentre.org.au) is a new, cross-disciplinary, and national research centre, which aims to create the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical, and inclusive automated decision-making. Funded by the Australian Research Council from 2020 to 2026, ADM+S is hosted at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia, with nodes in eight other Australian universities (Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, QUT, Swinburne University, University of Sydney, University of NSW and Western Sydney University).

The Centre brings together leading researchers in the humanities, social and technological sciences in an international industry, research and civil society network. Its priority domains for public engagement are news and media, transport, social services and health. The Centre of Excellence for ADM+S has four Research Programs: Data, Institutions, Machines and People and four Focus Areas: Health, Mobility and Transport, News and Media and Social Services .

The Role

Research Fellow for ADM in Global Contexts The Research Fellow will develop and collaborate on projects that explore the ways in which ADM is being integrated in different parts of the world.

Project(s) will explore the relative norms around privacy and personhood that shape ADM practices in different national contexts through case studies of innovations in ADM in global contexts that have been largely ignored in the dominant literature theorising AI, automation, robotics and ADM. Attending to one or more of the focus-area themes, the case studies will be used to identify differences and similarities between research on ADM in Australia, challenging our assumptions about how ADM operates around the world.

The Research Fellow will work with Professor Heather A Horst, the ARC CoE node leader at Western Sydney University and ICS Director. The position will conduct and manage primary research on the current practices and possibilities of automated decision-making in at least two globally-situated ethnographic contexts; publish research in high-quality outlets; engage and translate research with collaborators, international colleagues and industry partners; assist with project management and administration of project research; supervise research assistants and, where appropriate, co-supervise PhD students.

This research-focused role does not include a teaching load, but opportunities for developing and maintaining a teaching profile may be available during the course of the Research Fellowship.

Remuneration Package : Academic Level B $122,848 to $144,960 (comprising Salary $103,808 to $122,587 p.a., plus 17% Superannuation, and Leave Loading).

The George Institute is 700+ people around the world, all focused on improving the health of millions of people worldwide. As a medical research institute affiliated with leading universities and with projects in approximately 50 countries, we are challenging the status quo in healthcare to:
Find better treatments for the world's biggest health problems
Transform primary health care to support better health for more people
Harness the power of communities, governments and markets to improve health
Our innovative commercial enterprises help maximise our impact. Please visit our website [link removed] to read more about how we are addressing the world's biggest health problems.
A scholarship is now available for a suitably qualified candidate, to undertake a 3.5 year PhD degree, based at The George Institute for Global Health and University of New South Wales. The scholarship stipend is $30,000 per year for 3.5 years and students will be supported to apply for competitive scholarship funding.
Even in advanced countries like Australia, where each citizen is granted equal access to healthcare, women and people with a less favourable socioeconomic status (SES), seem to be disadvantaged in cardiovascular disease management. Internationally, studies have shown that women receive poorer management of stroke compared to men, but comprehensive Australian data are limited.  While studies identified SES disparities in stroke incidence and mortality in Australia, these were all conducted more than 10 years ago and now out-of-date in the context of modern reperfusion therapy and evidence-based risk factor management. Contemporary data are needed to address any sex/SES disparities across the patient journey with acute stroke, from the time of onset of symptoms, initial assessment and use of acute treatments, and discharge from hospital with various secondary prevention treatment packages according to recommended guidlines.
The successful candidate will have strong interest in Big Data analytics. A good command of biostatistics and analysis software (eg SAS, STATA, R) would also be an advantage. They will be enthusiastic, well-organised, and have excellent oral and written communication skills, as evidenced by publications, including in peer-reviewed journals. An ability to work autonomously and to be self-directed in learning, as well as contributing to team activities and discussions, will be necessary for the successful completion of this PhD. Experience in conducting scoping and systematic reviews is desirable.

Brighton Primary School was established in 1875 and is situated in the Bayside suburb of Brighton, 12 kilometres from the CBD.  Brighton fronts Port Phillip Bay. With almost six kilometres of coastline within Brighton's suburban boundary, there is a diverse range of attractions and activities for all. The school has strong generational ties and is well supported by the School Council and parents. 
Brighton Primary School’s design is traditional and has approximately 29 classes organised in year levels.  Brighton Primary School has been redeveloped with attention to maintaining the architectural integrity of the two brick Victorian buildings and also has a large number of re-locatable buildings.  Generally, they are grouped in year levels to support our collaborative approach to learning and teaching and maximise the student playing space.  The school is fully air-conditioned, and all rooms are uniformly furnished to provide a familiar environment for students as they progress across the school.
Brighton Primary School has an enrolment of approximately 630 students, which includes 18 students with moderate to profound hearing loss enrolled in the regional Hearing Unit hosted at the school.

Brighton Primary School has a rich, well-resourced Specialist Program.  There are purpose-built Science, Music and Art Rooms and a Gymnasium.  As well, there are literacy and numeracy resource rooms and a large shared learning space in the junior hall.  The Library is centrally located and available to students at lunchtime, as well as class time.  Adjoining it is the Performing Arts Centre, the LOTE room and the school canteen.  The school community raised the funds to fit-out these spaces and construct the covered walkway that connects all classrooms and specialist teaching areas.  Our Outside School Hours Care program, TeamKids, is accommodated in the LOTE room and the Gym.
A variety of spacious and shaded areas that are landscaped provide a safe and well-equipped play area for students.  There is a turfed oval and an athletics track, two adventure playgrounds, a fitness circuit and netball and down-ball courts. Below the junior play equipment is the Wonder garden, designed by our students.  It is both a teaching space and a playing area.  The Brighton Primary School community has funded the outdoor equipment and development of the grounds and are maintained by the School Council Facilities Committee and regular working bees.  As well, School Council employs a groundsman.

POSITION OVERVIEW: LOTE FRENCH TEACHER
Brighton Primary has a strong history of teaching a second language. We have currently completed a review of our current language program which saw Italian taught to students in Grade Prep to 4 then Chinese Mandarin taught to students in Grade 5 & 6. Our review showed that our community is in favour of a common language Grade Prep - 6 that supported a pathway through to secondary school. The review recommended that French be implemented Grade Prep to Grade 6 from 2021 onwards. Therefore, a key part of this role will be set up, build and launch this program, in collaboration with our existing language teacher.  The program will span Grade Prep to Grade 6 with a focus on both French language and culture.
The French teacher will demonstrate a high level of curriculum knowledge, quality teaching skills and successful application of assessment and reporting strategies appropriate for individual students in accordance with the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers.

As the classroom teacher gains experience his or her contribution to the school program beyond the classroom increases. All classroom teachers may be required to undertake other duties in addition to their rostered teaching duties provided the responsibility is appropriate to the salary range, qualifications, training and experience of the teacher.
Classroom teacher Range 2
Range 2 classroom teachers play a significant role in assisting the school to improve student performance and educational outcomes determined by the school strategic plan and state-wide priorities and contributing to the development and implementation of school policies and priorities.

Supervise and train one or more student teachers
Assist staff to use student data to inform teaching approaches that enable targets related to improving student learning outcomes to be achieved.
Classroom teacher Range 1
The primary focus of the range 1 classroom teacher is on further developing skills and competencies to become an effective classroom practitioner with structured support and guidance from teachers at higher levels and the planning, preparation and teaching of programs to achieve specific student outcomes. These teachers teach a range of students/classes and are accountable for the effective delivery of their programs.  Range 1 classroom teachers are skilled teachers who operate under general direction within clear guidelines following established work practices and documented priorities and may have responsibility for the supervision and training of one or more student teachers.
At range 1, teachers participate in the development of school policies and programs and assist in the implementation of school priorities.
The focus of a range 1 classroom teacher is on classroom management, subject content and teaching practice.  New entrants to the teaching profession in their initial teaching years receive structured support, mentoring and guidance from teachers at higher levels.
Under guidance, new entrants to the teaching profession will plan and teach student groups in one or more subjects and are expected to participate in induction programs and other professional learning activities that are designed to ensure the integration of curriculum, assessment and pedagogy across the school.

Performs and/or supervises tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice and school policy.  This may include the supervision and coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.  Supervision and coordination would be limited to ensuring routine tasks are performed to required standards.  Input into identifying training needs and development of education support class staff within the work area or educational program becomes an important feature at range 2.

Specialised support to achieve specific outcomes is a feature of range 2.  Typically this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the operation of a work area (e.g. managing the day to day operation of a school office) under the direction of the principal or another senior manager.

Provides support to teachers and students that is beyond the routine support provided at education support class Level 1, range 1.  Within an educational program assists teachers with the coordination of the support function, such as directing/organising the work of other support staff or providing a specialist support role. 

Undertakes medical intervention support tasks or other specialised student/teacher support roles that require specific training that must be updated from time to time.  The role is for a specific purpose for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.

Performs technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options.  Routine technical support in libraries, science and information technology laboratories would be typical examples.

An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.  Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee's position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.

About Griffith Health
Griffith Health is one of the largest and most diverse single academic health faculties in the Australian University sector. The Health Group consists of eight schools (Allied Health Sciences, Applied Psychology, Dentistry and Oral Health, Human Services and Social Work, Medicine, Medical Science, Nursing and Midwifery, and Pharmacy) and provides an extensive array of high quality and innovative education programs ranging from the enabling biomedical and social health sciences to professional and clinical disciplines. Currently over 10,000 students and more than 700 staff work within the Health Group, as well as a network clinical training sites and practitioners who collaborate in our research and teaching.

The project is a collaboration between the School of Allied Health Sciences, The Griffith Centre for Biomedical and Rehabilitation Engineering (GCORE, Menzies Health Institute Queensland), and the Advanced Design and Prototyping Technologies Institute (ADaPT).

The School of Allied Health Sciences, one of eight Schools in Griffith Health, is located at the Gold Coast and Nathan campuses. The School offers academic programs in the areas of Exercise and Sport, Nutrition and Dietetics, Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Rehabilitation Counselling and Speech Pathology. Research within the School is supported by the Menzies Health Institute Queensland and the Health Group. In addition, the School of Allied Health Sciences houses the Allied Health Clinics, which provide dietetics, exercise physiology, physiotherapy and speech pathology clinical services to the public, as well as providing opportunities for the clinical education.

The Griffith Centre of Biomedical and Rehabilitation Engineering (GCORE) represents people from Griffith University, the Gold Coast University Hospital, and other hospitals on the Gold Coast and in Brisbane, that are passionate about innovation, research and education across the 'Lifecycle' of orthopaedic and neuromusculoskeletal conditions. GCORE is run by an advisory board that embraces an active collaborative environment between researchers, engineers, clinicians and professionals, and institutional partnerships.

The successful applicant will be based on the Griffith University Gold Coast Campus.

The opportunity
Each year, approximately 300-400 newly incident cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) occur in Australia, resulting in a lifetime impact in terms of functional impairment, mental health of the individual and their family, and financial cost for the individual, the community, and the health system. Over 15,000 Australians currently live with SCI, with a total cost to healthcare systems amounting to more than $2B per year.

The BioSpine project aims to develop an integrated rehabilitation system that closes the brain-muscles-brain loop to restore movement and sensation in individuals with SCI. This works by combining multiple technologies into a single rehabilitation system, which includes brain-computer interfaces, rehabilitation robotics, electrical stimulation, drug therapy and extended reality feedback. A digital twin of the individual allows us to seamlessly interface these devices with the person, optimally adapting the rehabilitation. This integrated system was developed for the rehabilitation of people with spinal cord injury and it now requires further evaluation.

Mechanisms of treatment effect as well as clinical and economic outcomes will be assessed in a prospective longitudinal trial investigating the effectiveness of the intervention. Outcomes will include sensory, motor and autonomic nervous system assessments as well as other systemic and neurophysiological processes.

We are seeking a PhD candidate for whom the BioSpine intervention will be at the centre of their thesis. The candidate will be responsible for recruiting participants and implementing the training program as well as recording outcome assessments over time.

About you
We are looking for a PhD candidate to be part of a multidisciplinary team of engineers, industrial designers, and clinicians. The candidate should be highly organised, self-motivated, have demonstrated the capacity to undertake research to a PhD standard, and preferably have clinical experience in the field of spinal cord injury.

Successful candidates are expected to hold a bachelor's degree with first-class honours or second-class honours (Division A) or a Master's degree. These degrees should incorporate a significant research component (>33% of the total degree credit points) in either of exercise physiology, physiotherapy, exercise science, or related degrees.

Please refer to the following web page for eligibility requirements for entry into the program.

If you also wish to be considered for a scholarship, please refer to the following web page for scholarship and application tips . Selection of applicants for the award of a HDR scholarship involves consideration of your academic merit; research background; and the quality of the research training environment in which your research project will be undertaken, taking into account the alignment of the project with the University's strategic priorities.
