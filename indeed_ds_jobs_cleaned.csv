About Melbourne Law School:

Melbourne Law School (MLS) is Australia's first all-graduate law faculty. Melbourne Law School was the first faculty in Australia to teach law, and awarded this country's first law degrees.
Dr Parker has a position for a highly qualified Research Assistant to work, on a casual basis, on his ARC funded project ‘The Laws and Politics of Machine Listening’.

About the project:

Our devices are listening to us. Previous generations of audio-technology transmitted, recorded or manipulated sound. Today our digital voice assistants, smart speakers and a growing range of related technologies are increasingly able to analyse and respond to it as well. Scientists and engineers increasingly refer to this as “machine listening”, though the first widespread use of the term was in computer music. Machine listening is much more than just a new scientific discipline or vein of technical innovation however. It is also an emergent field of knowledge-power, of data extraction and colonialism, of capital accumulation, automation and control. This project uses interdisciplinary methods to subject machine listening to critical scrutiny. Some of these methods are conventionally academic, with a particular emphasis on science and technology studies, critical legal studies, sound studies, and art history. But some of the project’s methods are more artistic, since it will yield curatorial as well as scholarly outputs. For this reason, the project is conducted partly in collaboration with Liquid Architecture, an Australian organisation for the sonic arts. Though the successful applicant will be supervised by and work most closely with Dr Parker, they will also be in regular correspondence with the team at Liquid Architecture. More information about the project along with documentation of its public output are available at https://machinelistening.exposed/.

About the role:

The successful applicant must be able to work an average of one day a week for a minimum of six months, with the possibility of extending the contract for up to two years. The role will comprise high quality interdisciplinary research across art, music, science, technology, law and politics; assistance with preparation of outputs arising from the project across various media (especially on the project website); carrying out such other tasks that may be required on an as needs basis to ensure the completion of the project.

About you:

Applications are sought from candidates with relevant academic qualifications and expertise in at least one of the following fields: art, music, science and technology studies, critical theory, law or politics. Since the project is expressly interdisciplinary, experience or demonstrable interest in more than one of these fields is desirable. Successful candidates will have research, writing and listening skills, experience with basic website editing (content management systems, html, markdown) and a demonstrated capacity to work independently, meet deadlines, and contribute to the collaborative team effort of the ARC project. Shortlisted candidates should be available for interview.

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants
$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension


About the scholarship

The University of South Australia is welcoming applications for a PhD position in Artificial Intelligence/Computer Science to work on the project ""Application of Narrative Visualisation and Big Data to Improve High Value Manufacturing"" funded by BAE Systems and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.

Discrete manufacturing in Defence inherently relies on participants in the supply chain performing at a very high-quality level without full visibility of what is happening elsewhere in the chain. Human-in-the-loop decision making is fundamental in high value complex manufacture, both to correct defects and increase operational efficiency. The problem is a latency of presenting appropriate data to the critical decision makers. Data captured from disparate Industry 4.0 technologies can be transformed into a trusted data driven decision support tool, based on big data and smart visualisation techniques.

The project seeks to develop novel artificial intelligence techniques for analysing and linking data across the supply chain and to create interactive decision support tools for advanced manufacturing in Defence. The successful applicant will develop novel artificial intelligence methods for linking and analysing data across a manufacturing supply chain.

The recipient should have an outstanding academic record and a background in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence.

Eligibility

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements for a research degree program at the University of South Australia.

Candidates born in ITAR-proscribed countries and nationals of IT AR-proscribed countries are ineligible. Please check the list of denial countries in ITAR legislation at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/126.1 prior to applying.

Value

$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension. An additional $2,500 is available for equipment upon commencement.

How to apply and closing date

In the first instance, interested applicants should send their CV and academic transcript to Dr Wolfgang Mayer at Wolfgang.mayer@unisa.edu.au and following the initial endorsement by the supervisor, you will be required to go through the UniSA online application process.

We're looking for empathetic, curious and passionate people who are Full Stack Software Engineers to work in a young (as in business) start-up team. We're looking to build a new global technology company based around IoT tracking. We're working on construction right now but our intent is to expand that once we've nailed construction.
Why construction? Easy, construction is a massive global industry that still uses pen and paper in many cases. Right now it is an industry going through a revolution of technology and new ideas. Historically it's been seen as an industry with perennially low productivity and dangerous working conditions.
At Ynomia we are building IoT products that automate the capture of data in difficult construction environments (low power and no mobile reception) to help understand the status of a project. We then make meaning from the data we collect to help teams stay informed and improve the timeliness of decision-making. All so we can help construction teams manage information in real-time through an end-to-end IoT platform solution. They're glad we're here and we're happy to help.
Also, like a lot of good startups, there are so many ways this can go. I talk a lot about technology as a superpower. There's no point in the technology without the people you're trying to help. So here's a couple of super quick examples:
We track bins. Why? Because bins are a proxy for tidy sites (you're getting the good order vibe aren't you?) Tidy sites are safer sites. With 35 construction workers being seriously injured each day (see https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/construction) we clearly have a long way to go. We hypothesise that keeping track of the bins allows them to be emptied more efficiently and should create a virtuous cycle like better sites → less money spent on health and safety (as in payments to injured people) → more profitable sites → more incentive to make better sites.
We provide the real-time status of the critical path, high-value construction materials, like glass facades across the international supply chain. From their creation to their installation. Because you can't get electricians, plasterers doing their jobs until the building is sealed. So if you're a tradie you're very interested in when you need to be on-site and when you can do other things. If you work for a construction company we know that you stress about where those facades and you know that a blockage there can send the entire construction effort into panic mode. So you want to know what's going on with the facades too.
We track plant and equipment on an active job site. In this case, not only do we provide the realtime position of forklifts and scissor-lifts but we also are building safety compliance systems to automatically notify site teams of expiring inspections and unauthorized use.
Hopefully, you get the impression we're trying to create as many winners as possible. So our products have real value to the people who use them and the people who pay for them. And those are just the things we're doing right now. There are so many more stories to tell here.
We are building towards a vision that will create what we call the Connected Jobsite. An integrated platform to support construction teams with the location information of critical resource applications for plant and equipment, asset and machinery, safety and people, progress tracking and more...

Gain a solid understanding of the code base for one or more production machine learning models and data pipelines built with Python, SQL, Apache Spark and deployed on Google Cloud Platform. If you notice any bugs to fix, you’ll do it proactively.
Look for ways to introduce automation - which could involve small enhancements to code, investigating or adding new features to a model or optimising / performance tuning of models
Assisted a senior data scientist to scale a model using kubernetes or kubeflow - so it is easier to move into production and scale from X million customers to 5X million customers
Another squad may see you develop APIs to help other analytics or technology teams in the business consume and use your data science products
The datasets this teamwork on are huge, so typical tools of the trade will be Python, SQL, Spark, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes / GKE / Kubeflow, APIs and more from day one!

Sounds great, what skills and experience do you need to apply?!

At least a bachelor’s degree and our preference is in Computer Science, Software Engineering or a similar field (perhaps Aeronautical Engineering?) which combines strong numerical, data and technical skills - understanding data structures, algorithms, CI/CD, etc.
We prefer if you have already used; Kubernetes or Kubeflow for containerisation of data science solutions and either GCP, AWS or Azure
You will definitely need full, unrestricted Australian work rights and you will be based in Sydney
Heavy preference will be given to good commercial experience with data science using real customer data for big companies or start-ups
Availability preferred to be 1-4 weeks, no relocation or visa sponsorship is available

What will set you apart from all the other applicants?

We will first look at your commercial experience - where have you worked? What have you have built and how you communicate that in your CV and Cover Letter.

Automated Decision-Making in Global Contexts, ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision- Making & Society (ADM+S). Institute for Culture and Society

About Us

The Institute for Culture and Society carries out research on the transformations in culture and society in the context of contemporary global change. It operates as a leading international centre for interdisciplinary, engaged and collaborative scholarship in the humanities and social sciences for a digital age. Research at the Institute for Culture and Society is organised around an integrated program of research focusing on a number of broad themes including cities and economies, digital life, diversity and globalization, heritage and environment.

The Institute is one of four Research Institutes at the University, and the only one predominantly focused on the discipline area of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences (HASS). An important role of the Institute is to help develop the University’s overall research performance through external income generation and high-quality publications. It also conducts profile-raising activities through organising major conferences, developing a network of similar research entities nationally and internationally, hosting visiting scholars, and forging strategic partnerships with external organisations and communities. Public and community engagement is an integral aspect of the Institute’s work. The Institute for Culture & Society hosts the Western Sydney University node of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.

The ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society (ADM+S) (http://admscentre.org.au) is a new, cross-disciplinary, and national research centre, which aims to create the knowledge and strategies necessary for responsible, ethical, and inclusive automated decision-making. Funded by the Australian Research Council from 2020 to 2026, ADM+S is hosted at RMIT in Melbourne, Australia, with nodes in eight other Australian universities (Monash University, University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, QUT, Swinburne University, University of Sydney, University of NSW and Western Sydney University).

The Centre brings together leading researchers in the humanities, social and technological sciences in an international industry, research and civil society network. Its priority domains for public engagement are news and media, transport, social services and health. The Centre of Excellence for ADM+S has four Research Programs: Data, Institutions, Machines and People and four Focus Areas: Health, Mobility and Transport, News and Media and Social Services .

The Role

Research Fellow for ADM in Global Contexts The Research Fellow will develop and collaborate on projects that explore the ways in which ADM is being integrated in different parts of the world.

Project(s) will explore the relative norms around privacy and personhood that shape ADM practices in different national contexts through case studies of innovations in ADM in global contexts that have been largely ignored in the dominant literature theorising AI, automation, robotics and ADM. Attending to one or more of the focus-area themes, the case studies will be used to identify differences and similarities between research on ADM in Australia, challenging our assumptions about how ADM operates around the world.

The Research Fellow will work with Professor Heather A Horst, the ARC CoE node leader at Western Sydney University and ICS Director. The position will conduct and manage primary research on the current practices and possibilities of automated decision-making in at least two globally-situated ethnographic contexts; publish research in high-quality outlets; engage and translate research with collaborators, international colleagues and industry partners; assist with project management and administration of project research; supervise research assistants and, where appropriate, co-supervise PhD students.

This research-focused role does not include a teaching load, but opportunities for developing and maintaining a teaching profile may be available during the course of the Research Fellowship.

Remuneration Package : Academic Level B $122,848 to $144,960 (comprising Salary $103,808 to $122,587 p.a., plus 17% Superannuation, and Leave Loading).

Located within Physiotherapy at Austin Health, in Heidelberg, the research team of Professor Berlowitz examines sleep and breathing dysfunction in neuromuscular disease, especially in motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal cord injury. The research program works closely with the Victorian Respiratory Support Service (VRSS) within the Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, the state-wide service that provides domiciliary ventilatory support for over 1,000 individuals. Our research encompasses epidemiology and cohort studies, sleep and respiratory discovery experiments, especially upper airway physiology and imaging, controlled clinical trials, disease registry development, health systems research and health data analytics. Our research involves
collaboration across disciplines, technologies and countries.

The research team have recently finished a large body of work and are building capacity for future research. As part of this capacity building and development, Professor Berlowitz was recently awarded a Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) grant; A multi-centre randomised controlled trial of polysomnographic titration of non-invasive ventilation in motor neurone disease. The grant will support the completion of a randomized controlled, assessor-blinded trial in 7 motor neurone disease care centres across Australia.

Under the direction of the project and laboratory leader Professor David Berlowitz, a Trial Manager will be employed to assist with management of the research arising from the above-mentioned grant opportunity. The Trial Manager will be integral in managing and driving the program of research.

The position will entail providing strategic oversight of the project implementation and management activities, including management of
collaborators and the broader Australia-wide team. The Trial Manager will assist with data collection, analysis, preparation of publications and presentations for scientific meetings. This role requires an enthusiastic, independent and motivated individual, with exceptional teamwork skills and a desire to contribute to an exciting program of research. This position is primarily located in Heidelberg; however, being a multi-centre trial across Australia, some of the development and evaluation of interventions will occur in alternative settings, so travel to these locations will likely be necessary.

We foster a values-based culture of innovation and creativity to enhance the research performance of the University and to achieve excellence in teaching and research outcomes. We invest in developing the careers and wellbeing of our students and staff and expect all our leaders to live our values of:

Collaboration and teamwork

If you are interested in employing UAVs, multispectral and LiDAR in extracting phenotyping parameters and understanding the underlying mechanism that governs crop yield, this PhD fellowship can be for you.
Understanding the interaction of genotype with the environment is of prime importance, which can be achieved by the measurement of phenotypic traits of the crop. The field of phenomics is a large-scale collection of data-set to study, analyze and understand the interaction of genomic variations with the varying environment by revealing the relation between genotype and phenotypes. Traditionally, plant phenotyping has been achieved by manually collecting the data from the plants to select the best performing genotype. Technological advancement in the plant phenotyping has been a topic of interest among interdisciplinary researchers in recent years. The efforts have been put into using and optimizing the available technologies to adapt to the need for plant phenotyping. From the perspective of non-invasive measurement of phenotypic traits, the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of UAV based multispectral, photogrammetric and LiDAR is promising.
Project Outline and Tasks
Your primary responsibilities will be to:
· Optimise multispectral, photogrammetric and LiDAR sensor systems integrated on UAV platforms for high-throughput field phenotyping in grain crops, considering factors such as data sampling rate, field-of-view, sensitivity and modalities required for sensor operation.
Identify best practises in data processing and analysis for plant phenotyping, including generation of point cloud metrices, vegetation and morphological indices, segmentation, voxelization, classification, and 3D reconstruction of crops.
Participate in scientific conferences and workshops as well as events in the area of plant phenotyping and remote sensing.
Publish your findings in scientific journals.
Qualifications

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants
$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension


About the scholarship

The University of South Australia is welcoming applications for a PhD position in lmmersive Analytics and Data Storytelling to work on the project ""Application of Narrative Visualisation and Big Data to Improve High Value Manufacturing"" funded by BAE Systems and the Innovative Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre.

The successful applicant will explore and develop visualisation and data storytelling systems in immersive environments-including virtual reality, augmented reality, and tabletop displays-to elucidate insight in advanced manufacturing environments. Manufacturing in Defence inherently relies on participants in the supply chain performing at a very high-quality level without full visibility of what is happening elsewhere in the chain. Human-in-the-loop decision making is fundamental in high value complex manufacturing, both to correct defects and increase operational efficiency. The problem is a latency of presenting appropriate data to the critical decision makers. Data captured from disparate Industry 4.0 technologies can be transformed into a trusted data driven decision support tool, based on big data and smart visualisation techniques.

The successful applicant should have an outstanding academic record and a background in information visualisation and XR technologies. The applicant should have both strong computer science skills and design skills. The applicant will be part of a team of visualisation, data, and artificial intelligence experts and working closely with stakeholders at BAE to address real-world issues faced by advanced manufacturing.

The successful applicant will be based in the Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments (IVE). As a world leader in augmented reality and virtual reality, our researchers are leaders in many areas of AR and VR research including wearable computing, interface design, empathic computing, 30 visualisation, perception, and telepresence. Our vast experience in advanced manufacturing, Internet of Things (loT), interactive art, and design for healthcare and defence allows us to work in collaboration with our industry partners to transform industry and solve large-scale societal challenges.

Eligibility

The scholarship is open to commencing domestic and international applicants.

Applicants must meet the eligibility requirements for a research degree program at the University of South Australia.

Candidates born in ITAR-proscribed countries and nationals of IT AR-proscribed countries are ineligible. Please check the list of denial countries in ITAR legislation at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/126.1 prior to applying.

Value

$37,285 per year for 3 years with the option for a 6-month extension. An additional $2,500 is available for equipment upon
commencement.

How to apply and closing date

In the first instance, interested applicants should send their CV and academic transcript to Dr Andrew Cunningham at Andrew.Cunningham@unisa.edu.au and following the initial endorsement by the supervisor, you will be required to go through the UniSA online application process.

This scholarship will remain open for applications until filled.

Access CSIRO’s world-class facilities and resources while completing your PhD
Apply for a CSIRO-WSU PhD Scholarship now!

CSIRO Agriculture and Food and Western Sydney University (WSU) are offering a joint scholarship to a PhD candidate who has undertaken studies in agricultural science and plant biology. The student will work within a research team investigating genetics and physiology of sodicity tolerance in cotton.
Cotton is one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in Australia. The Australian cotton industry is known for high productivity and economic return, and has significantly contributed to the viability of many rural communities. Increasing cotton sodicity tolerance is of importance as much of Australia’s cotton is grown in sodic soils with a very high clay content and high pH. In such soils, excessive Na can impair cotton nutrient uptake and use, cause nutrient related stresses and reduce nutrient use efficiency. Consequently, limiting cotton productivity.
CSIRO cotton breeders have made significant progress identifying a leaf Na+ exclusion trait in cultivated tetraploid cotton species which has been bred into elite CSIRO germplasm and has potential to improve cotton sodicity tolerance. This project will investigate the inheritance and physiological mechanism of this trait and look at molecular markers applicable to its future fast-track breeding in cotton. The outcomes of this project will include new rapid screening tools for identifying and developing sodicity tolerant cotton, and new understanding on mechanisms of cotton sodicity tolerance.
During this project some of the tasks the student may undertake include:
Planning, preparing and conducting field, laboratory and glasshouse experiments at both CSIRO and WSU facilities.
Applying innovative approaches to testing and developing new cost-effective screening protocols for cotton tolerance to soil sodicitiy.
Collecting, processing and analysing plant materials, and undertaking phenotyping and genotyping in different experiments.
Collating, analysing and interpreting data using appropriate computer programs.
